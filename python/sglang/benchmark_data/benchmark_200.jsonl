Johnson, St. Paul's Church-Yard.\n\nMDCCLXXXVIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\n\nIn delineating the Heroine of this Fiction, the Author attempts to\ndevelop a character different from those generally portrayed. This woman\nis neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It would be vain\nto mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to\nremark, how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the\noriginals of great masters. They catch the gross parts; but the subtile\nspirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation disgusts,\nwhen grace was expected to charm.\n\nThose compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing\ncaptives, where the soul of the author is exhibited, and animates the\nhidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm, they live in the scenes\nthey represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track,\nsolicitous to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath,\naccording to the prescribed rules of art.\n\nThese chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an\necho--even of the sweetest sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime\nbeams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be of their own creating--or\nthe prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying\nprinciple, fades and dies.\n\nIn an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has\nthinking powers is displayed. The female organs have been thought too\nweak for this arduous employment; and experience seems to justify the\nassertion. Without arguing physically about _possibilities_--in a\nfiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived\nfrom the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but\ndrawn by the individual from the original source.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: Rousseau.]\n\n[Footnote B: I here give the Reviewers an opportunity of being very\nwitty about the Paradise of Fools, &c.]\n\n\n\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. I.\n\n\nMary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who\nmarried Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in\nher temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues,\nindeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the _shews_ of\nthings, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as\nthe generality approved of. She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and\nthe years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments,\nwithout having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into\nthe polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished\nto be united to; but her father soon after recommending another in a\nmore distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted to his will, and\npromised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.\n\nWhile they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style,\nand seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they\nwooed rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful\ncountry, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;\nfor the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved,\nand sought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and\nafter eating an immoderate dinner, generally fell asleep: this\nseasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then\nvisit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow\nof health with his wife's countenance, which even rouge could not\nenliven, it is not necessary to say which a _gourmand_ would give the\npreference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more\nagreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was\nbut the shadow of a sound, and she had, to complete her delicacy, so", "acc_len": 1.7611408199643495}

I won’t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.", "acc_len": 1.856046065259117}

How Otto Saw the Great Emperor,\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD.\n\nBetween the far away past history of the world, and that which lies near\nto us; in the time when the wisdom of the ancient times was dead and\nhad passed away, and our own days of light had not yet come, there lay a\ngreat black gulf in human history, a gulf of ignorance, of superstition,\nof cruelty, and of wickedness.\n\nThat time we call the dark or middle ages.\n\nFew records remain to us of that dreadful period in our world's history,\nand we only know of it through broken and disjointed fragments that have\nbeen handed down to us through the generations.\n\nYet, though the world's life then was so wicked and black, there yet\nremained a few good men and women here and there (mostly in peaceful\nand quiet monasteries, far from the thunder and the glare of the worlds\nbloody battle), who knew the right and the truth and lived according to\nwhat they knew; who preserved and tenderly cared for the truths that the\ndear Christ taught, and lived and died for in Palestine so long ago.\n\nThis tale that I am about to tell is of a little boy who lived and\nsuffered in those dark middle ages; of how he saw both the good and the\nbad of men, and of how, by gentleness and love and not by strife and\nhatred, he came at last to stand above other men and to be looked up to\nby all. And should you follow the story to the end, I hope you may find\nit a pleasure, as I have done, to ramble through those dark ancient\ncastles, to lie with little Otto and Brother John in the high\nbelfry-tower, or to sit with them in the peaceful quiet of the sunny\nold monastery garden, for, of all the story, I love best those early\npeaceful years that little Otto spent in the dear old White Cross on the\nHill.\n\nPoor little Otto's life was a stony and a thorny pathway, and it is well\nfor all of us nowadays that we walk it in fancy and not in truth.\n\n\n\n\nI. The Dragon's House.\n\nUp from the gray rocks, rising sheer and bold and bare, stood the walls\nand towers of Castle Drachenhausen. A great gate-way, with a heavy\niron-pointed portcullis hanging suspended in the dim arch above, yawned\nblackly upon the bascule or falling drawbridge that spanned a chasm\nbetween the blank stone walls and the roadway that winding down the\nsteep rocky slope to the little valley just beneath. There in the lap of\nthe hills around stood the wretched straw-thatched huts of the peasants\nbelonging to the castle--miserable serfs who, half timid, half fierce,\ntilled their poor patches of ground, wrenching from the hard soil barely\nenough to keep body and soul together. Among those vile hovels played\nthe little children like foxes about their dens, their wild, fierce eyes\npeering out from under a mat of tangled yellow hair.\n\nBeyond these squalid huts lay the rushing, foaming river, spanned by a\nhigh, rude, stone bridge where the road from the castle crossed it, and\nbeyond the river stretched the great, black forest, within whose gloomy\ndepths the savage wild beasts made their lair, and where in winter time\nthe howling wolves coursed their flying prey across the moonlit snow and\nunder the net-work of the black shadows from the naked boughs above.\n\nThe watchman in the cold, windy bartizan or watch-tower that clung to\nthe gray walls above the castle gateway, looked from his narrow window,\nwhere the wind piped and hummed, across the tree-tops that rolled in\nendless billows of green, over hill and over valley to the blue and\ndistant slope of the Keiserberg, where, on the mountain side, glimmered\nfar away the walls of", "acc_len": 1.90978886756238}

Rye or wheat, oats, peas, beets, cabbage, pork products, and potatoes are the staples.

Tina is angry when she finds out, but forgives Tosh and supports her when she discovers she is not pregnant again. They fall out when Tosh accuses her of not wanting a baby, and Tosh punches her after taunting her. Tina again forgives her and decides to try and reconcile Tosh with her family by arranging a lunch for them. Her mother Judy (Jo Martin) comes, but her father makes an excuse, uncomfortable with Tosh's sexuality due to his Christian faith. Judy storms out when Tina tells her about their attempts to have a baby, upsetting Tosh further. Tina is devastated when Stan reveals that he is dying from prostate cancer, and is even more upset when she learns that Stan knew about his illness 3 years prior to him telling the family. She and Tosh urge Stan to see a private doctor, however he reveals that Stan's cancer is too aggressive to be cured, which leaves Tina distraught. Tina supports Sonia when she falls ill, and she confides in her that she spent the money from the charity calendar she organised on a gastric band in Bulgaria, to impress her husband Martin (James Bye).

From an early age, he showed himself to be a reckless romantic – while still a child, he stole some jewels and attempted to take ship to Holland, presumably to join the army. When he was thirteen, the First Bishops' War broke out, and the young nobleman sneaked out of Gordon Castle (one account says he climbed over the wall) and hurried to the Highlands, where he raised a brigade of clansmen from his father's estates to fight the Covenanters. His first experience of war was at Megray Hill, where his Highlanders scattered in the face of enemy cannon fire.\nFollowing the peace, Lord Lewis travelled to France, where he enlisted as an ordinary pikeman in an infantry regiment, in order to learn his soldiering from the ground up. After three years, he traveled to England, working his way north by serving on both sides in the English Civil War, first in the royalist army and then in the Scottish Covenanter forces of his uncle, the Earl of Argyll, the same army he had fought against in 1639.\nEventually returning home, the sixteen-year-old nobleman seduced and married the fiancée of his absent elder brother, Viscount Aboyne. He served on both sides in the Scottish Civil War, playing an important role in his father's occupation of Aberdeen in 1646, where he engaged an enemy cavalry commander in single combat and then storming the town. Going into exile after the defeat of the royalists, he traveled again to France; in rapid succession, he succeeded his brother and father as Earl of Enzie and Marquess of Gordon, and by 1651, he was allowed to return to Scotland, even though he refused to conform to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (he was probably a Roman Catholic).\nIn 1645 Lord Lewis attacked Brodie Castle in Moray and setting it afire destroyed important archives and documents detailing the origins of the illustrious Clan Brodie. This despicable act secured Clan Brodie's place among the great mysteries of Scotland.\nHe died aged 26 or 27, leaving a young widow (whom he had apparently converted to Catholicism), three daughters, and a four-year-old son who would eventually become the 1st Duke of Gordon. Miles Gourdon, a cavalry commander in the French army known as the chevalier or count of \"Crolis\", was perhaps an illegitimate son, as he is said to have been a brother of the duke.His reputation among historians has varied; he is the clearest hero in the Civil War narrative of his kinsman Patrick Gordon of Ruthven, while John Buchan regarded him as wild and headstrong to the point of insanity.\nPassage 3:\nChristopher Lambert (MP)\nChristopher Lambert, of Winchester, Hampshire, was an English politician.\nHe was the second son of William Lambert of Winchester and a servant of Sir William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester.\nLambert was a Member of Parliament for Bridport in 1593.\nPassage 4:\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester  (c. 1532 – 24 November 1598) was an English nobleman, the son of John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester and his first wife, Elizabeth Willoughby.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nMulti-document summarization (MDS), the transformation of a set of documents into a short text containing their most important aspects, is a long-studied problem in NLP. Generated summaries have been shown to support humans dealing with large document collections in information seeking tasks BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . However, when exploring a set of documents manually, humans rarely write a fully-formulated summary for themselves. Instead, user studies BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 show that they note down important keywords and phrases, try to identify relationships between them and organize them accordingly. Therefore, we believe that the study of summarization with similarly structured outputs is an important extension of the traditional task.\nA representation that is more in line with observed user behavior is a concept map BIBREF5 , a labeled graph showing concepts as nodes and relationships between them as edges (Figure FIGREF2 ). Introduced in 1972 as a teaching tool BIBREF6 , concept maps have found many applications in education BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , for writing assistance BIBREF9 or to structure information repositories BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . For summarization, concept maps make it possible to represent a summary concisely and clearly reveal relationships. Moreover, we see a second interesting use case that goes beyond the capabilities of textual summaries: When concepts and relations are linked to corresponding locations in the documents they have been extracted from, the graph can be used to navigate in a document collection, similar to a table of contents. An implementation of this idea has been recently described by BIBREF12 .\nThe corresponding task that we propose is concept-map-based MDS, the summarization of a document cluster in the form of a concept map. In order to develop and evaluate methods for the task, gold-standard corpora are necessary, but no suitable corpus is available. The manual creation of such a dataset is very time-consuming, as the annotation includes many subtasks. In particular, an annotator would need to manually identify all concepts in the documents, while only a few of them will eventually end up in the summary.\nTo overcome these issues, we present a corpus creation method that effectively combines automatic preprocessing, scalable crowdsourcing and high-quality expert annotations. Using it, we can avoid the high effort for single annotators, allowing us to scale to document clusters that are 15 times larger than in traditional summarization corpora. We created a new corpus of 30 topics, each with around 40 source documents on educational topics and a summarizing concept map that is the consensus of many crowdworkers (see Figure FIGREF3 ).\nAs a crucial step of the corpus creation, we developed a new crowdsourcing scheme called low-context importance annotation. In contrast to traditional approaches, it allows us to determine important elements in a document cluster without requiring annotators to read all documents, making it feasible to crowdsource the task and overcome quality issues observed in previous work BIBREF13 . We show that the approach creates reliable data for our focused summarization scenario and, when tested on traditional summarization corpora, creates annotations that are similar to those obtained by earlier efforts.\nTo summarize, we make the following contributions: (1) We propose a novel task, concept-map-based MDS (§ SECREF2 ), (2) present a new crowdsourcing scheme to create reference summaries (§ SECREF4 ), (3) publish a new dataset for the proposed task (§ SECREF5 ) and (4) provide an evaluation protocol and baseline (§ SECREF7 ). We make these resources publicly available under a permissive license.\nTask\nConcept-map-based MDS is defined as follows: Given a set of related documents, create a concept map that represents its most important content, satisfies a specified size limit and is connected.\nWe define a concept map as a labeled graph showing concepts as nodes and relationships between them as edges. Labels are arbitrary sequences of tokens taken from the documents, making the summarization task extractive. A concept can be an entity, abstract idea, event or activity, designated by its unique label. Good maps should be propositionally coherent, meaning that every relation together with the two connected concepts form a meaningful proposition.\nThe task is complex, consisting of several interdependent subtasks. One has to extract appropriate labels for concepts and relations and recognize different expressions that refer to the same concept across multiple documents. Further, one has to select the most important concepts and relations for the summary and finally organize them in a graph satisfying the connectedness and size constraints.\nRelated Work\nSome attempts have been made to automatically construct concept maps from text, working with either single documents BIBREF14 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 or document clusters BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 .

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nBlack Death\nThe Black Death (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality or the Plague) was a bubonic plague pandemic occurring in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1346 to 1353. It is the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, causing the deaths of 75–200 million people, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis spread by fleas, but during the Black Death it probably also took a secondary form, spread by person-to-person contact via aerosols, causing pneumonic plague.The Black Death was the beginning of the second plague pandemic. The plague created religious, social and economic upheavals, with profound effects on the course of European history.\nThe origin of the Black Death is disputed. Genetic analysis points to the evolution of Yersinia pestis in the Tian Shan mountains on the border between Kyrgyzstan and China 2,600 years ago. The immediate territorial origins of the Black Death and its outbreak remains unclear with some pointing towards Central Asia, China, the Middle East and Europe. The pandemic was reportedly first introduced to Europe during the siege of the Genoese trading port of Kaffa in Crimea by the Golden Horde army of Jani Beg in 1347. From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, Western Asia and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily and the Italian Peninsula. There is evidence that once it came ashore, the Black Death mainly spread person-to-person as pneumonic plague, thus explaining the quick inland spread of the epidemic, which was faster than would be expected if the primary vector was rat fleas causing bubonic plague. In 2022, it was discovered that there was a sudden surge of deaths in what is today Kyrgyzstan from the Black Death in the late 1330s; when combined with genetic evidence, this implies that the initial spread may not have been due to Mongol conquests in the 14th century, as previously speculated.The Black Death was the second great natural disaster to strike Europe during the Late Middle Ages (the first one being the Great Famine of 1315–1317) and is estimated to have killed 30 percent to 60 percent of the European population, as well as about one-third of the population of the Middle East. The plague might have reduced the world population from c. 475 million to 350–375 million in the 14th century. There were further outbreaks throughout the Late Middle Ages and, with other contributing factors (the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages), the European population did not regain its level in 1300 until 1500. Outbreaks of the plague recurred around the world until the early 19th century.\n\nNames\nEuropean writers contemporary with the plague described the disease in Latin as pestis or pestilentia, 'pestilence'; epidemia, 'epidemic'; mortalitas, 'mortality'. In English prior to the 18th century, the event was called the \"pestilence\" or \"great pestilence\", \"the plague\" or the \"great death\". Subsequent to the pandemic \"the furste moreyn\" (first murrain) or \"first pestilence\" was applied, to distinguish the mid-14th century phenomenon from other infectious diseases and epidemics of plague.The 1347 pandemic plague was not referred to specifically as \"black\" in the time of occurrence in any European language, though the expression \"black death\" had occasionally been applied to fatal disease beforehand. \"Black death\" was not used to describe the plague pandemic in English until the 1750s; the term is first attested in 1755, where it translated Danish: den sorte død, lit. 'the black death'. This expression as a proper name for the pandemic had been popularized by Swedish and Danish chroniclers in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and in the 16th and 17th centuries was transferred to other languages as a calque: Icelandic: svarti dauði, German: der schwarze Tod, and French: la mort noire. Previously, most European languages had named the pandemic a variant or calque of the Latin: magna mortalitas, lit. 'Great Death'.The phrase 'black death' – describing Death as black – is very old. Homer used it in the Odyssey to describe the monstrous Scylla, with her mouths \"full of black Death\" (Ancient Greek: πλεῖοι μέλανος Θανάτοιο, romanized: pleîoi mélanos Thanátoio). Seneca the Younger may have been the first to describe an epidemic as 'black death', (Latin: mors atra) but only in reference to the acute lethality and dark prognosis of disease.

Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \"King Kong\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \"The Colossal Kongs\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \"randomly drawn\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \"Krusher Kong\" instead of the more generic \"King Kong\". In Texas he held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship for 73 days, until he lost it to Eclipse on August 14, 1998. He would later hold the Pro Wrestling Championship (PCW) title in 2001 as well as the Texas Championship Wrestling (later renamed Xtreme Championship Wrestling) singles title and the tag team titles twice in 2003.

Its apparent stylistic consistency is largely due to conscious efforts of architects over several centuries to echo each other's work and preserve a strong sense of historical continuity, mirroring that of the French monarchy and state; American essayist Adam Gopnik has written that \"The continuity the Louvre represents is the continuity of the French state.\" For example, from the 1620s to the 1650s Jacques Lemercier thoroughly replicated the Lescot Wing's patterns for his design of the northern half of the western wing of the Cour Carrée.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>The federal government supports the development of airport infrastructure in three different ways. First, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. Second, Congress has authorized airports to assess a local passenger facility charge (PFC) on each boarding passenger, subject to specific federal approval. PFC revenues can be used for a broader range of projects than AIP funds, including \"landside\" projects such as passenger terminals and ground access improvements. Third, federal law grants investors preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued by state and local governments for airport improvements (subject to compliance with federal rules). Airports may also draw on state and local funds and on operating revenues, such as lease payments and landing fees. A federal role in airport infrastructure first developed during World War II. Prior to the war, airports were a local or private responsibility, with federal support limited to the tax exclusion of municipal bond interest. National defense needs led to the first major federal support for airport construction. After the war, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-377) continued federal a id, although at lower levels than during the war years. Initially, much of this spending supported conversion of military airports to civilian use. In the 1960s, substantial funding also was used to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets. In 1970, Congress responded to increasing congestion, both in the air and on the ground at U.S. airports, by passing two laws. The first, the Airport and Airway Development Act, established the forerunner programs of AIP: the Airport Development Aid Program and the Planning Grant Program. The second, the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, dealt with the revenue side of airport development, establishing the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF, also referred to as the Aviation Trust Fund, and in this report, the trust fund). The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-248 ; the 1982 Act) created the current AIP and reactivated the trust fund. For a more detailed legislative history of AIP, see Appendix A of this report. Eight years later, amid concerns that the existing sources of funds for airport development would be insufficient to meet national airport needs, the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 (Title IX of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, P.L. 101-508 ) allowed the Secretary of Transportation to authorize public agencies that control commercial airports to impose a passenger facility charge on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at their airports. Different airports use different combinations of AIP funding, PFCs, tax-exempt bonds, state and local grants, and airport revenues to finance particular projects. Small airports are more likely to be dependent on AIP grants than large or medium-sized airports. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. Each of these funding sources places various legislative, regulatory, or contractual constraints on airports that use it. The availability and conditions of one source of funding may also influence the availability and terms of other funding sources. In a 2015 study, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that airport-generated net income financed about 38% of airports' capital spending, AIP 33%, PFCs 18%, capital contributions by airport sponsor (often a state or municipality) or by other sources such as an airline or tenant 6%, and state grants nearly 5%. AIP provides federal grants to airports for airport development and planning. Participants range from very large publicly owned commercial airports to small general aviation airports that may be privately owned but are available for public use. AIP funding is usually limited to construction of improvements related to aircraft operations, such as runways and taxiways. Commercial revenue-producing facilities are generally not eligible for AIP funding, nor are operating costs. The structure of AIP funds distribution reflects congressional priorities and the objectives of assuring airport safety and security, increasing airport capacity, reducing congestion, helping fund noise and environmental mitigation costs, and financing small state and community airports. The main financial advantage of AIP to airports is that, as a grant program, it can provide funds for capital projects without the financial burden of debt financing, although airports are required to provide a modest local match to the federal funds. Limitations on the use of AIP grants include the range of projects that AIP can fund and the requirement that recipients adhere to all program regulations and grant assurances. Federal law requires the Secretary of Transportation to publish a national plan for the development of public-use airports in the United States. This appears as a biannual Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publication called the National Plan of Integrated Airport System s (NPIAS) . For an airport to receive AIP funds, it must be listed in the NPIAS. A", "acc_len": 2.199546485260771}

Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge", "acc_len": 2.2108843537414966}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage:\nFatted calf\nFatted calf is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament.  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father \"kills the fatted calf\" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\n\nIn modern usage, \"killing the fatted calf\" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\".\nQuestion:\n\"In the Bible, whose return heralded the killing of \"\"the fatted calf\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nLoving Father\nPassage:\nKingdom of the Algarve\nThe Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: Reino do Algarve, from the Arabic Gharb al-Andalusغرب الأندلس), later the Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: Reino dos Algarves), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nIt was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. \nIn actuality, it was just an honorific title for the Algarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces. \n\nThe title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silves in 1189. As this conquest did not take all of the Algarve, D. Sancho never used the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, but instead it was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.\n\nHistory\n\nReconquista\n\nDuring the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.\n\nFirst conquest\n\nIn 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur the Almohad Caliph in person.\n\nThe conquest of Algarve\n\nWith the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, Mûsâ Ibn Muhammad Ibn Nassir Ibn Mahfûz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as Aben Mafom.\n\nAben Mafom, King of Niebla and Emir of Algarve, trying to counter the achievements made by the Portuguese in their territories, declared vassalage to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese. \n\nThe Emir's vow of vassalage to Castille however did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.\n\nThe entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as King of Portugal and the Algarve would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile's claim to the Algarve and was designed to demonstrate the rights of the Portuguese monarch on the region concerned.\n\nThe issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of King of the Algarve for King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of Al-Gharb Al-Andalus on the other side of the Guadiana river. The kings of Castile, and then Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.\n\nAge of Discoveries\n\nDuring the Age of Discoveries, the Algarve", "acc_len": 2.2312925170068025}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nRed Dragon (2002 film)\nRed Dragon is a 2002 psychological thriller film based on the 1981 novel by Thomas Harris. It was directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. It is the third film of the Dino De Laurentiis Company production, last produced by Universal and last starred by actor Anthony Hopkins. It follows The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Hannibal (2001) as a prequel, being followed by Hannibal Rising (2007). The film sees FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) enlisting the help of serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to catch another killer, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes). Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Philip Seymour Hoffman also star.\nIt is considered the fourth of the five released films regarding Hannibal Lecter. The novel was previously adapted into the film Manhunter (1986). Both films feature the same cinematographer, Dante Spinotti. After turning down the Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal (2001), Silence of the Lambs screenwriter Ted Tally returned to write Red Dragon. It was released on October 4, 2002 to generally positive reviews from critics, who deemed it to be an improvement over Hannibal, but inferior to The Silence of the Lambs.      It was a box office success, earning $209 million worldwide against a $78 million budget. An origin story, titled Hannibal Rising was released in 2007.\n\nPlot\nIn 1980, FBI agent Will Graham visits forensic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter to discuss a case. Graham has been working with Lecter on a psychological profile of a serial killer who removes edible body parts from his victims; Graham is certain the killer is a cannibal. Realizing Graham is close to discovering he is the killer, Lecter stabs him, but Graham subdues him before falling unconscious. Lecter is imprisoned in an institution for the criminally insane, and Graham, traumatized, retires to Florida with his family.\nYears later, in 1986, another serial killer nicknamed the Tooth Fairy has killed two families – the Jacobis and the Leeds – during full moons. With another full moon approaching, special agent Jack Crawford persuades Graham to help develop the killer's profile. After visiting the crime scenes in Atlanta, Georgia, and Birmingham, Alabama, and speaking with Crawford, Graham concludes that he must consult Lecter. Lecter taunts Graham but agrees to help.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy is Francis Dolarhyde, who kills as directed by his alternate personality, which he calls the Great Red Dragon, named after the William Blake painting The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun, which he has tattooed on his back. He believes that each victim brings him closer to becoming the Dragon, as his psychopathology originates from his childhood abuse by his grandmother.\nFreddy Lounds, a tabloid reporter for the National Tattler, pursues Graham for leads on the Tooth Fairy. A letter from the Tooth Fairy is discovered hidden in Lecter's cell, expressing admiration for Lecter and an interest in Graham and suggesting that Lecter reply through the personals section of the Tattler, which he does with Graham's home address, forcing Graham's wife, Molly, and son, Josh, to relocate. While in hiding, Graham teaches Molly how to fire a handgun.\nTo lure out the Tooth Fairy, Graham gives an interview to Lounds, disparaging the killer as an impotent homosexual and that Lecter was only feigning interest in him. Enraged, Dolarhyde kidnaps Lounds, glues him to a wheelchair and reveals himself as the Great Red Dragon. Dolarhyde shows Lounds photos he took of his victims before and after he murdered them. Dolarhyde forces Lounds to recant his allegations on tape, sets him on fire and sends him rolling and crashing into a company sign outside the Tattler offices.\nAt his job in a St. Louis photo lab, Dolarhyde gives blind co-worker Reba McClane a ride to her home and they begin a relationship. However, his alternate personality demands that he kill her. Desperate to stop the Dragon's control over him, Dolarhyde goes to the Brooklyn Museum, tears apart the Blake painting, and eats it.\nGraham realizes that the Tooth Fairy knew the layout of his victims' houses from their home videos. He deduces that he works for the company that edits the home movies and transfers them to video. He visits the company processing plant to ask for information, and is spotted by Dolarhyde as he returns from Brooklyn.\nIn a panic, Dolarhyde goes to Reba's house. She has spent the evening with a co-worker, Ralph Mandy. After Reba enters her home, Dolarhyde kills Ralph, kidnaps Reba, takes her to his house, and sets it ablaze.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>讲者1：见解。 然后也非常感谢我们四位嘉宾非常精彩的分享。 那么接下来我们就话不多说，倒入我们的圆桌讨论环节。 首先第一个话题，相信我们在座的各位嘉宾以及在场的观众都是比较有共鸣的一个话题，他就是年龄焦虑。 那么在一个理想化的老龄化社会中，其实衰老是非常自然而然的。 但是在现实中，年龄焦虑遍布公众舆论。 例如今年年仅 18 岁的谷爱凌，作为自由式滑雪项目中最年轻的奥运冠军，成为了媒体与商业的宠儿。 在职场中也有很多的工作设立了 35 岁门槛，这致使人们对于变老普遍带有不安的情绪。 然后也为我们建构一个积极的老龄化社会带来了一些阻碍。 那么请为各位嘉宾对于身处年龄焦虑的，众多年轻人和中年人有什么建议？ 然后对于是就社会现象又有什么解决的方案？ 那不如我们先从陆杰华教授开始。 我们很想知道您从一个社会角度，社会学的角度，您对年龄焦虑的看法是什么？\n讲者2：好谢谢主持人我觉得提了一个非常好的一个这个问题，因为每个人都会这个关注自身的这个年龄的增长。 那是年龄焦虑我觉得可能是对这个就是衰老的一个焦虑。 我觉得现在我们对所有的人不仅是今天的老年人，也是包括今天的这个中年人，青年人包括年轻人。 我们一定要告诉每个人，我们都在变老的路上，我们所做的这一切其实我们他都是有定数的。 那么我们要做好一定的一种我们这个准备。 不管是年轻人还是中年人。 我想的有一句话，就时间不一定能够造就有一个伟人，因为今天的年轻人这个都是互联网的时代，他们希望能够成为科学家，成为像谷爱凌那样的这个体育明星，成为政治家。 但是我们一定要记住，时间不一定造就一个伟人，但时间一定会成交一个老人的，我们每个人都会变老的，我们所做的一切不仅是关注今天的老人，也要关注。\n讲者2：当我们未来的老的时候，这个我们怎么去这个应对？ 所以我觉得在这样的一个这个状况下，我们怎么样构建一个这个不分年龄，人人共享的年龄友好型的这种社会和那理念是非常这个重要的。 这样的话我们才能够这个不仅是尊老爱老孝老，也能使年轻人呐这个在尊重生命的这个同时能够发挥自己的一个才智。 我就简单说这些。\n讲者1：非常感谢陆建华老师的分享。 其他嘉宾有想分享的吗？ 我听到李轩您刚刚在演讲中也提到了一个积极老龄化的态度。 然后包括您说年轻人应该有这样一个非常积极非常乐观的一个态度去看待年龄。 那您对年龄焦虑，尤其是年轻人和中年人面对的这个状况有哪些想法？\n讲者3：谢谢主持人确实蛮有意思的一个问题，我觉得其实在每个年龄阶段可能都不回避。 没有办法回避。 刚才也像陆教授谈的，其实每个人在世界上都是要来来往往的，四季有春夏秋冬。 人肯定也有，像你们这时候年轻的时候，像我们人到中年，然后再往后走的时候说不焦虑是假的，我觉得这个再智慧的长者，其实比如说我们说这个活过百岁的杨匠先生，他能那么看待的这个看人一生。 其实我觉得到最后叫焦虑，也好叫一种年轻时候的恐惧，到后面的无可奈何的接受。 其实这些都是不可否认的。 但是从另外一个角度来看，像你谈到的专家也谈到就是这种我们有一个积极老龄化或者我们叫怎么看待人的一生？ 其实永远持一个积极的态度。 我觉得是特别重要的，就是我们走过的路上其实都是风景，我们看到每一城对不起，我们看到每一城其实真的是各有各的美好。\n讲者3：就像我刚才提到其实你怎么看待你的生，我怎么看待老化这个事情？ 如果你觉得年龄不是一个限制，其实年龄就不会限制到你。 就是有很多的研究就发现，比如说让您让老年人在穿上他当年年轻时候的衣服，他的身体的机能立刻就又满血复活了。 其实听起来蛮奇妙的，但是确实是有这样的研究的。 所以简而言之，我觉得一个方面就是首先坦然的面对，我觉得人生有四季不焦虑是假的。 但是另外一个方面我们要意识到我们说人真的是有很多的能动性的。 其实如果时间在流逝，但是你不把年龄给自己设限，在人生的任何的时候，其实它都是你的资本。 而且只要你有一个积极的态度，我觉得生活其实永远是阳光的，就像刚才陆尔介绍的，其实一直走到人生的最后都可以很平和的，也像刚才李明教授谈到的，我觉得无疾而终。 平稳地走过去其实都是转就有可能的。 我是这么想，谢谢。\n讲者4：主持人，我补充两句，那个问题，你说，我特别同意刚才陆教授和这个李教授谈的。 我觉得其实因为现代社会的人我们应该心情更平和一点，为什么要心情更平和呢？ 原因就是因为我们过去 49 年新中国建立的时候，人均一区寿命只有 35 岁，我们现在是 77.3 岁，也就是说我们人人都实现了这个人生，这个就七十古来夕。 那么我相信现代的年轻人，你们未来活 100", "acc_len": 2.249433106575964}

Please review the contents of the article and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2015)\nThis article is about the family of vitamers. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione.\nVitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2.\nVitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed].\nChemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.\nVitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.\nBacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.\nThree synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>This report provides background information and issues for Congress on multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC), which are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC. Congress's decisions on these issues could affect defense acquisition practices, defense funding requirements, and the defense industrial base. A contract that the Air Force has for the procurement of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Launch Services (ELS) has sometimes been referred to as a block buy, but it is not an example of block buy contracting as discussed in this report. The Air Force in this instance is using the term block buy to mean something different. This report does not discuss the ELS contract. (For additional discussion, see \" Terminology Alert: Block Buy Contracting vs. Block Buys \" below.) In discussing MYP, BBC, and incremental funding, it can be helpful to distinguish contracting mechanisms from funding approaches. The two are often mixed together in discussions of DOD acquisition, sometimes leading to confusion. Stated briefly Funding approaches are ways that Congress can appropriate funding for weapon procurement programs, so that DOD can then put them under contract. Examples of funding approaches include traditional full funding (the standard or default approach), incremental funding, and advance appropriations. Any of these funding approaches might make use of advance procurement (AP) funding. Contracting mechanisms are ways for DOD to contract for the procurement of weapons systems, once funding for those systems has been appropriated by Congress. Examples of contracting mechanisms include annual contracting (the standard or default DOD approach), MYP, and BBC. Contracting mechanisms can materially change the total procurement cost of a ship. The use of a particular funding approach in a defense acquisition program does not dictate the use of a particular contracting mechanism. Defense acquisition programs consequently can be implemented using various combinations of funding approaches and contracting mechanisms. Most DOD weapon acquisition programs use a combination of traditional full funding and annual contracting. A few programs, particularly certain Navy shipbuilding programs, use incremental funding as their funding approach. A limited number of DOD programs use MYP as their contracting approach, and to date three Navy shipbuilding programs have used BBC as their contracting approach. The situation is summarized in Table 1 . This report focuses on the contracting approaches of MYP and BBC and how they compare to annual contracting. Other CRS reports discuss the funding approaches of traditional full funding, incremental funding, and advance appropriations. What is MYP, and how does it differ from annual contracting? MYP, also known as multiyear contracting, is an alternative to the standard or default DOD approach of annual contracting. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item, without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. To illustrate the basic difference between MYP and annual contracting, consider a hypothetical DOD program to procure 20 single-engine aircraft of a certain kind over the 5-year period FY2018-FY2022, at a rate of 4 aircraft per year: Under annual contracting , DOD would issue one or more contracts for each year's procurement of four aircraft. After Congress funds the procurement of the first four aircraft in FY2018, DOD would issue one or more contracts (or exercise a contract option) for those four aircraft. The next year, after Congress funds the procurement of the next four aircraft in FY2019, DOD would issue one or more contracts (or exercise a contract option) for those four aircraft, and so on. Under MYP , DOD would issue one contract covering all 20 aircraft to be procured during the 5-year period FY2018-FY2022. DOD would award this contract in FY2018, at the beginning of the five-year period, following congressional approval to use MYP for the program, and congressional appropriation of the FY2018 funding for the program. To continue the implementation of the contract over the next four years, DOD would request the FY2019 funding for the program as part of DOD's proposed FY2019 budget, the FY2020 funding as part of DOD's proposed FY2020 budget, and so on.

Mexico, Turkey, Estonia are ranked ahead of the U.S. in incidence of homicides. A U.S. male aged 15–24 is 70 times more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight (G-8) largest industrialized nations in the world (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, Russia). In a broader comparison of 218 countries the U.S. is ranked 111. In 2010, the U.S.' homicide rate is 7 times higher than the average for populous developed countries in the OECD, and its firearm-related homicide rate was 25.2 times higher. In 2013, the United States' firearm-related death rate was 10.64 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants, a figure very close to Mexico's 11.17, although in Mexico firearm deaths are predominantly homicides whereas in the United States they are predominantly suicides. (Although Mexico has strict gun laws, the laws restricting carry are often unenforced, and the laws restricting manufacture and sale are often circumvented by trafficking from the United States and other countries.) Canada and Switzerland each have much looser gun control regulation than the majority of developed nations, although significantly more than in the United States, and have firearm death rates of 2.22 and 2.91 per 100,000 citizens, respectively. By comparison Australia, which imposed sweeping gun control laws in response to the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, has a firearm death rate of 0.86 per 100,000, and in the United Kingdom the rate is 0.26. In the year of 2014, there were a total of 8,124 gun homicides in the U.S. In 2015, there were 33,636 deaths due to firearms in the U.S, with homicides accounting for 13,286 of those, while guns were used to kill about 50 people in the U.K., a country with population one fifth of the size of the U.S. population. More people are typically killed with guns in the U.S. in a day (about 85) than in the U.K. in a year, if suicides are included. With deaths by firearm reaching almost 40,000 in the U.S. in 2017, their highest level since 1968, almost 109 people died per day. A study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2018, states that the worldwide gun death reach 250,000 Yearly and the United States is among only six countries that make up half of those fatalities.\n\nParagraph 2: Cromwell also served as the head coach of the USC Trojans football program from 1909 to 1910, and from 1916 to 1918. His involvement with USC football goes back even farther; he is known to have officiated USC games as early as 1903, and he played (along with the coaches of both teams) for USC opponent Harvard School in a 1905 game due to the weakness of the Harvard roster. In his first term as coach, 1909 to 1910, he posted a record of 10–1–3, but this was exclusively against southern California competition, with no major colleges on the schedule. Like many schools, USC switched from football to rugby, from 1911 to 1913. Cromwell returned as football coach in 1916, by which time USC's teams had begun to be known as the Trojans. By this point, the university was facing competition which more regularly included major colleges such as California, Utah and Stanford, and his relative lack of expertise in the sport was more readily apparent. World War I also depleted the team's ranks in 1917 and 1918. In his final three years his record was still respectable at 11–7–3, though only 4–4–1 against major colleges. In his final season in 1918, USC was 2–2–2.  They did not play a home game in Los Angeles until December 14 due to a citywide ban on public gatherings during the Spanish flu epidemic.  Cromwell was replaced as head football coach following the season by Gus Henderson. During his tenure, Cromwell compiled a 21–8–6 record. Apart from Sam Barry, who took over the 1941 team in the wake of Howard Jones' death, Cromwell was the last USC football coach for whom it was not his primary sport. He also coached the USC basketball team in 1918, though they only played two games against the Los Angeles Athletic Club, losing both.\n\nParagraph 3: A United Nations peacekeeping force – UNAMIR – had been stationed in Rwanda since October 1993", "acc_len": 2.2698412698412698}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nA hashtag is a keyphrase represented as a sequence of alphanumeric characters plus underscore, preceded by the # symbol. Hashtags play a central role in online communication by providing a tool to categorize the millions of posts generated daily on Twitter, Instagram, etc. They are useful in search, tracking content about a certain topic BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , or discovering emerging trends BIBREF2 .\nHashtags often carry very important information, such as emotion BIBREF3 , sentiment BIBREF4 , sarcasm BIBREF5 , and named entities BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . However, inferring the semantics of hashtags is non-trivial since many hashtags contain multiple tokens joined together, which frequently leads to multiple potential interpretations (e.g., lion head vs. lionhead). Table TABREF3 shows several examples of single- and multi-token hashtags. While most hashtags represent a mix of standard tokens, named entities and event names are prevalent and pose challenges to both human and automatic comprehension, as these are more likely to be rare tokens. Hashtags also tend to be shorter to allow fast typing, to attract attention or to satisfy length limitations imposed by some social media platforms. Thus, they tend to contain a large number of abbreviations or non-standard spelling variations (e.g., #iloveu4eva) BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , which hinders their understanding.\nThe goal of our study is to build efficient methods for automatically splitting a hashtag into a meaningful word sequence. Our contributions are:\nOur new dataset includes segmentation for 12,594 unique hashtags and their associated tweets annotated in a multi-step process for higher quality than the previous dataset of 1,108 hashtags BIBREF10 . We frame the segmentation task as a pairwise ranking problem, given a set of candidate segmentations. We build several neural architectures using this problem formulation which use corpus-based, linguistic and thesaurus based features. We further propose a multi-task learning approach which jointly learns segment ranking and single- vs. multi-token hashtag classification. The latter leads to an error reduction of 24.6% over the current state-of-the-art. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method by using hashtag segmentation in the downstream task of sentiment analysis. Feeding the automatically segmented hashtags to a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis method on the SemEval 2017 benchmark dataset results in a 2.6% increase in the official metric for the task.\nBackground and Preliminaries\nCurrent approaches for hashtag segmentation can be broadly divided into three categories: (a) gazeteer and rule based BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , (b) word boundary detection BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , and (c) ranking with language model and other features BIBREF16 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . Hashtag segmentation approaches draw upon work on compound splitting for languages such as German or Finnish BIBREF19 and word segmentation BIBREF20 for languages with no spaces between words such as Chinese BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 . Similar to our work, BIBREF10 BansalBV15 extract an initial set of candidate segmentations using a sliding window, then rerank them using a linear regression model trained on lexical, bigram and other corpus-based features. The current state-of-the-art approach BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 uses maximum entropy and CRF models with a combination of language model and hand-crafted features to predict if each character in the hashtag is the beginning of a new word.\nGenerating Candidate Segmentations. Microsoft Word Breaker BIBREF16 is, among the existing methods, a strong baseline for hashtag segmentation, as reported in BIBREF14 and BIBREF10 . It employs a beam search algorithm to extract INLINEFORM0 best segmentations as ranked by the n-gram language model probability: INLINEFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the word sequence of segmentation INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 is the window size. More sophisticated ranking strategies, such as Binomial and word length distribution based ranking, did not lead to a further improvement in performance BIBREF16 . The original Word Breaker was designed for segmenting URLs using language models trained on web data. In this paper, we reimplemented and tailored this approach to segmenting hashtags by using a language model specifically trained on Twitter data (implementation details in § SECREF26 ). The performance of this method itself is competitive with state-of-the-art methods (evaluation results in § SECREF46 ). Our proposed pairwise ranking method will effectively take the top INLINEFORM3 segmentations generated by this baseline as candidates for reranking.\nHowever, in prior work, the ranking scores of each segmentation were calculated independently, ignoring the relative order among the top INLIN", "acc_len": 2.272108843537415}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Paragraph 1: The longstanding president of the  \"International Women's Rights League\" (\"Ligue du droit international des femmes\" / LDIF), she has tackled on the international level the fashion for invoking of \"cultural relativism\" as a justification for opposing the universal application of women's rights.   She has also taken a lead in combatting violence against young girls with immigrant backgrounds:  issues on which she has campaigned include excision, forced expatriation and various classes of \"honour crime\".   A particularly high-profile cause célèbre into which she launched herself became identified by slogan-headline \"Mères d’Alger\" (loosely, \"Mothers of Algiers\"):   A shared colonial history had left several hundred thousand Algerians in France, many of whom came from families that had ended the Algerian War on the \"wrong\" side.   During the 1980s a succession of cases came to the fore in which, following marital ructions, fathers with Algerian connections had removed their children to Algeria, in defiance of French court rulings granting custody of the children in question to their mothers remaining in France.   In an effort to provide a remedy for these cases, in August 1986 the governments of France and Algeria signed a convention, but a view quickly emerged that this had failed to provide an effective remedy.   Under Sugier's leadership, the LDIF played a major role in highlighting the issues.   A particular atrocity in point was the \"Sohane affair\", which came up in 2002.   The LDIF received an appeal from the murdered girl's father and sisters that it should join itself as a civil party to the ensuing legal case against the murder suspect and his accomplice, in order \"to support the struggle for the memory of Sohane and to ensure that the same thing should not happen in the future to any other person\".   The trial evidently took some time to prepare, but when it was held, between 31 March and 7 April 2007, the killer and his accomplice were both found guilty.   The killer received a 25-year jail sentence while the accomplice was sentenced to 8 years.   The accomplice now made the tactical error of lodging an appeal.   The LDIF legal team seized the opportunity and lodged their own appeal.   The LDIF was represented at the trial by Linda Weil-Curiel, a lawyer with a reputation in the field of women's rights:   Sugier and Weil-Curiel had made their important first visit to the dead girl's sister and father together.   Throughout the trial Weil-Cureil had emphasized the sexist aspect of the case, and the advocate general clearly took full cognisance of her submissions.   The LDIF was represented not in respect of the criminal aspects of the matter but as a civil litigant:  on 18 September 2006 the court responsible for the civil aspect of the case accepted that the LDIF intervention was \"admissible and well founded\".   The appeal in respect of the accomplice was heard at the Seine-Saint-Denis Court of Assizes between 8 June and 14 June 2007; a ten-year jail term was substituted for the earlier, lesser sentence.   After the verdict, Annie Sugier produced a rapid succession of statements and articles celebrating the fact that for the first time, under pressure from the LIDF's involvement in the case, a court in France had been persuaded to respond to the acts of torture and barbarism of which Sohane Benziane was the victim, to acknowledge the concept of \"a sexist crime\".\n\nParagraph 2: The following spring, an unnamed journalist reveals the uselessness of Phalanx and the truth of Solanum, sparking a crisis later dubbed the \"Great Panic\" in which global order collapses, with rioting, breakdown of essential services, and indiscriminate culling of citizens killing more people than the zombies themselves. Russia forces a decimation of its military to end rampant mutinies. Ukraine uses VX gas on refugees and its own citizens in an attempt to weed out the infected. Iran and Pakistan destroy each other in a brief nuclear exchange over a refugee crisis. When the US military stages a high-profile battle in Yonkers, New York, their conventional warfare tactics prove insufficient against the overwhelming horde of zombies, and the military is routed on live television. The catastrophe causes the US President to suffer a nervous breakdown, resulting in the Vice President and his cabinet invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment and forcibly removing him from office. The US government evacuates west of the Rocky Mountains and establishes a new capital in Honolulu, Hawaii.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nJames Chadwick\nSir James Chadwick,  (20 October 1891 – 24 July 1974) was a British physicist who was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron in 1932. In 1941, he wrote the final draft of the MAUD Report, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious atom bomb research efforts. He was the head of the British team that worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He was knighted in Britain in 1945 for his achievements in physics.\nChadwick graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1911, where he studied under Ernest Rutherford (known as the \"father of nuclear physics\"). At Manchester, he continued to study under Rutherford until he was awarded his MSc in 1913. The same year, Chadwick was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He elected to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger in Berlin. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a continuous spectrum, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when World War I broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the Ruhleben internment camp.\nAfter the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.\nDuring the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the Tube Alloys project to build an atom bomb, while his Manchester lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, he became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.\n\nEducation and early life\nJames Chadwick was born in Bollington, Cheshire, on 20 October 1891, the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, a cotton spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a domestic servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to Manchester, leaving him in the care of his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School, which his family had to turn down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the Central Grammar School for Boys in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them.Chadwick chose to attend Victoria University of Manchester, which he entered in 1908. He meant to study mathematics, but enrolled in physics by mistake. Like most students, he lived at home, walking the 4 miles (6.4 km) to the university and back each day. At the end of his first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by Ernest Rutherford, who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of 1 gram (0.035 oz) of radium, a unit of measurement which would become known as the curie. Rutherford's suggested approach was unworkable—something Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford—so Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick's first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford", "acc_len": 2.290249433106576}

Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member.

Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across the aisle, Charles Ridulph, the older brother of the victim, frowned and bowed his head. More than 58 years ago, he helped search for Maria after she vanished from a street corner near their home while playing in the snow with a friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken.

He launched a six-month investigation that included a review of some 4,500 pages of documents -- old police and FBI reports, grand jury transcripts, trial transcripts, affidavits for search and arrest warrants, and even CNN's five-part series on the case, \"Taken,\" which raised questions about whether the courtroom reconstruction of history was unfairly one-sided.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nGrown Ups (film)\nGrown Ups is a 2010 American comedy film directed by Dennis Dugan, written by Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf, produced by Sandler and Jack Giarraputo, and starring Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph. The film tells a story of five lifelong friends who won their junior high school basketball championship in 1978. They reunite three decades later for a 4th of July weekend after learning about the sudden death of their basketball coach.\nProduced by Sandler's Happy Madison Productions in association with Relativity Media, Grown Ups was released in the United States on June 25, 2010, by Columbia Pictures. Despite receiving unfavorable reviews from critics, it grossed $272 million and led to a sequel, Grown Ups 2, in 2013.\n\nPlot\nIn 1978, childhood friends Lenny Feder, Eric Lamonsoff, Kurt McKenzie, Marcus Higgins, and Rob Hilliard win their junior high basketball championship. They celebrate at a lake house with their coach Robert \"Buzzer\" Ferdinando.\nThirty years later in 2008, Lenny is a wealthy and successful Hollywood talent agent, married to fashion designer Roxanne and has three children: Greg, Keith, and Becky. Eric claims to co-own a lawn furniture company and has two children: Donna and Bean; his wife Sally still breastfeeds Bean. Kurt is a stay-at-home father, and has two children: Andre and Charlotte, his wife Deanne is pregnant with their third child, and her mother Ronzoni lives with them. Marcus is a slacker and lothario. Rob is married to his much older fourth wife Gloria.\nWhen Buzzer dies, the five friends reunite for his funeral in their hometown with their families. Lenny rents the Earnshaw family's lake house for everyone to stay over Fourth of July weekend, though his family is leaving early to attend Roxanne's fashion show in Milan. He pushes his boys to play outside and runs into his childhood opponent Dickie, who claims Lenny's foot was out of bounds when he made the winning shot.\nAs the friends spread Buzzer's ashes, Rob breaks down over his failed marriages and reveals that he has invited his estranged daughters Jasmine, Amber, and Bridget to visit. The men play “arrow roulette”, shooting an arrow straight into the air, and Rob wins by not running for cover, but the arrow impales his left foot, causing him to 'snap' at Gloria from the pain. \nLenny is thrilled to find the kids playing with cup-and-string telephones. Realizing the positive impact the weekend is having on their children, Roxanne tells Lenny to cancel their Milan trip and stay at the lake instead.\nEveryone visits Water Wizz where Marcus flirts with Jasmine and Amber after buying them skimpy bikinis, and Eric teaches Bean to drink cow's milk. The families cause chaos throughout the park: the wives attract a bodybuilder, then jeer at his high-pitched Canadian accent; Rob assaults a slide attendant when he insults Bridget, and Eric ignores Donna's warning about a chemical in the pool that turns urine blue. At the zipline attraction, Lenny's group meets up with Dickie, accompanied by his former teammates. One of them, Wiley, is severely injured after crashing into a shed while sliding down the zipline using his feet.\nThe next day, Rob attacks Marcus, mistakenly believing that he slept with Jasmine, and Marcus admits to feeling insecure compared to his happily married friends. Everyone comes clean about the state of their lives: Roxanne confronts Lenny for canceling their flight to Milan before they left home, and he explains he wanted their family to have a normal vacation and to rein in his children's respectful attitudes; Deanne confronts Kurt for spending time with the Feders' nanny Rita, but Kurt retaliates by pointing out how she under-appreciates him; Eric reveals that he was laid off from his job, and was showing off the whole time so the others wouldn't humiliate him; Rob admits what everybody already knows – that he wears a toupee. Gloria helps everyone reconcile, and Lenny and Kurt offer to help Eric start a new business.\nOn their last day at the lake house, Lenny and his friends agree to a rematch against Dickie, Robideaux, Muzby, Tardio, and Malcolm. The game culminates in Lenny and Greg facing Dickie and his son, but Lenny misses the game-deciding shot. As the families watch the Fourth of July fireworks, Lenny tells Roxanne that he let Dickie's family win to get him off his case, and felt that his own family needed to know what losing feels like. A drunken Marcus plays another game of arrow roulette, and the crowd flees in panic.", "acc_len": 2.292517006802721}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nBritish nationality law\nThe primary law governing nationality in the United Kingdom is the British Nationality Act 1981, which came into force on 1 January 1983. Regulations apply to the British Islands, which include the UK itself and the Crown dependencies, and the 14 British Overseas Territories.\nThe six classes of British nationality each have varying degrees of civil and political rights, due to the UK's historical status as a colonial empire. The principal class of British nationality is British citizenship, which is associated with the British Islands. British nationals associated with an overseas territory are British Overseas Territories citizens (BOTCs). Almost all BOTCs (except for those from Akrotiri and Dhekelia) have also been British citizens since 2002. Individuals connected with former British colonies may hold residual forms of British nationality, which do not confer an automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom and generally may no longer be acquired. These residual nationalities are the statuses of British Overseas citizen, British subject, British National (Overseas), and British protected person.\nAll persons born in the British Islands before 1 January 1983 were automatically granted citizenship by birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. Individuals born in those territories since that date only receive citizenship at birth if at least the mother is a British citizen or holds settled status. Foreign nationals may naturalise as British citizens after meeting a minimum residence requirement (usually five years) and acquiring settled status.\nThe United Kingdom was previously a member state of the European Union (EU) and British citizens held full EU citizenship. They had held automatic and permanent permission to live and work in any EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country and were able to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Despite the UK's withdrawal from the union in 2020, British citizens continue to hold permanent permission to work and reside in the Republic of Ireland as part of the Common Travel Area.\n\nTerminology\nThe distinction between the meaning of the terms citizenship and nationality is not always clear in the English language and differs by country. Generally, nationality refers to a person's legal belonging to a sovereign state and is the common term used in international treaties when addressing members of a country, while citizenship usually means the set of rights and duties a person has in that nation. This distinction is clearly defined in many non-English speaking countries but not in the Anglosphere. Historically, an individual associated with Britain was neither a national nor a citizen, but a British subject. British citizenship was not created until passage of the British Nationality Act 1981. This Act defined six types of nationality with varying degrees of civil and political rights, dependent on a person's connections with the United Kingdom, overseas territories, or former colonies. British citizens hold their status because of a close connection with the British Islands, usually through their own (or parents' or grandparents') birth, adoption, naturalisation, or registration as citizens of the UK.\n\nTypes of British nationality\nThere are six types of British nationality: any person who is a British citizen, British Overseas Territories citizen (BOTC), British Overseas citizen (BOC), British National (Overseas) (BN(O)), British subject, or British protected person is a British national. Of these statuses, only British citizenship grants automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom. British Overseas Territories are areas outside of the British Islands where the UK holds sovereignty. Since 2002, nearly all BOTCs also hold British citizenship, except for those associated with Akrotiri and Dhekelia.The other four categories are residual nationality classes that generally cannot be acquired. BOCs are people connected with former British colonies who have no close ties to the UK or overseas territories. BN(O)s are Hong Kong residents who voluntarily registered for this status before the territory's transfer to China in 1997. British subjects hold their status through a connection either to former  British India or to what is now the Republic of Ireland as they existed before 1949. British protected persons come from areas controlled by the British Empire but were never formally incorporated as Crown territory; this includes protectorates, protected states, mandated territories, and Indian princely states.\n\nHistory\nDevelopment from feudal allegiance\nBefore the concept of nationality was codified in legislation, inhabitants of English communities owed allegiance to their feudal lords, who were themselves vassals of the monarch. This system of loyalty, indirectly owed to the monarch personally, developed into a general establishment of subjecthood to the Crown. Calvin's Case in 1608 established the principle of jus soli, that all those who were born within Crown dominions were natural-born subjects.

Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nIn the spirit of the brevity of social media's messages and reactions, people have got used to express feelings minimally and symbolically, as with hashtags on Twitter and Instagram. On Facebook, people tend to be more wordy, but posts normally receive more simple “likes” than longer comments. Since February 2016, Facebook users can express specific emotions in response to a post thanks to the newly introduced reaction feature (see Section SECREF2 ), so that now a post can be wordlessly marked with an expression of say “joy\" or “surprise\" rather than a generic “like”.\nIt has been observed that this new feature helps Facebook to know much more about their users and exploit this information for targeted advertising BIBREF0 , but interest in people's opinions and how they feel isn't limited to commercial reasons, as it invests social monitoring, too, including health care and education BIBREF1 . However, emotions and opinions are not always expressed this explicitly, so that there is high interest in developing systems towards their automatic detection. Creating manually annotated datasets large enough to train supervised models is not only costly, but also—especially in the case of opinions and emotions—difficult, due to the intrinsic subjectivity of the task BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . Therefore, research has focused on unsupervised methods enriched with information derived from lexica, which are manually created BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . Since go2009twitter have shown that happy and sad emoticons can be successfully used as signals for sentiment labels, distant supervision, i.e. using some reasonably safe signals as proxies for automatically labelling training data BIBREF5 , has been used also for emotion recognition, for example exploiting both emoticons and Twitter hashtags BIBREF6 , but mainly towards creating emotion lexica. mohammad2015using use hashtags, experimenting also with highly fine-grained emotion sets (up to almost 600 emotion labels), to create the large Hashtag Emotion Lexicon. Emoticons are used as proxies also by hallsmarmulti, who use distributed vector representations to find which words are interchangeable with emoticons but also which emoticons are used in a similar context.\nWe take advantage of distant supervision by using Facebook reactions as proxies for emotion labels, which to the best of our knowledge hasn't been done yet, and we train a set of Support Vector Machine models for emotion recognition. Our models, differently from existing ones, exploit information which is acquired entirely automatically, and achieve competitive or even state-of-the-art results for some of the emotion labels on existing, standard evaluation datasets. For explanatory purposes, related work is discussed further and more in detail when we describe the benchmarks for evaluation (Section SECREF3 ) and when we compare our models to existing ones (Section SECREF5 ). We also explore and discuss how choosing different sets of Facebook pages as training data provides an intrinsic domain-adaptation method.\nFacebook reactions as labels\nFor years, on Facebook people could leave comments to posts, and also “like” them, by using a thumbs-up feature to explicitly express a generic, rather underspecified, approval. A “like” could thus mean “I like what you said\", but also “I like that you bring up such topic (though I find the content of the article you linked annoying)\".\nIn February 2016, after a short trial, Facebook made a more explicit reaction feature available world-wide. Rather than allowing for the underspecified “like” as the only wordless response to a post, a set of six more specific reactions was introduced, as shown in Figure FIGREF1 : Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry. We use such reactions as proxies for emotion labels associated to posts.\nWe collected Facebook posts and their corresponding reactions from public pages using the Facebook API, which we accessed via the Facebook-sdk python library. We chose different pages (and therefore domains and stances), aiming at a balanced and varied dataset, but we did so mainly based on intuition (see Section SECREF4 ) and with an eye to the nature of the datasets available for evaluation (see Section SECREF5 ). The choice of which pages to select posts from is far from trivial, and we believe this is actually an interesting aspect of our approach, as by using different Facebook pages one can intrinsically tackle the domain-adaptation problem (See Section SECREF6 for further discussion on this). The final collection of Facebook pages for the experiments described in this paper is as follows: FoxNews, CNN, ESPN, New York Times, Time magazine, Huffington Post Weird News, The Guardian, Cartoon Network, Cooking Light, Home Cooking Adventure, Justin Bieber, Nickelodeon, Spongebob, Disney.\nNote that thankful was only available during specific time spans related to certain events, as Mother's Day in May 2016.\nFor", "acc_len": 2.315192743764172}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Devilish desires' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a letter, published in Russia's pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, he wrote: \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The longer I live,\" he continued, \"the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kalashnikov, or AK-47, is one of the world's most familiar and widely used weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that more than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been sold worldwide.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>讲者1：好，我那个简单地回应一下刚才那个老师提的问题，就是我们项目里面，它这个就是刚才介绍这个案例里面有没有关于贫困的这个可持续发展里面贫困的指标。 其实这个刚才我在案例里面就谈到了其实它集体经济组织的新的跟市场主体的合作里面，它其实是有贫困户的参与的。 比如说在这个贫困户的参与过程里面，可能有一些政府的投入，这算成了一股份的优化过程里面，其实贫困户是他在原有的这个分分红上面的话，他们是舍得有在去年也就是 2019 年以前，他都是设的有这个贫困户的这个股份的，他有一部分资金是拿出来盈利以后拿出来作为贫困户的一个分红。\n讲者1：而针对这部分贫困户的发展的话，其实在这个过程里面，因为其实大家都知道贫困为什么造成贫困难，无非要么就是没有劳动力，要么就是因病等等这些原因这些因素。 而在这个发展过程里面，他们其实是有一个帮扶机制的，比如说企业的帮扶，比如说优先解决就业等等这样的一些帮扶，集体今日组织里面可能也更多。 有一些比如说专门的人来负责他这个产业的一些支持技术的培训呐。\n讲者1：而刚才这个案例里面其实有个东西我没有讲，因为它其实里面我们当地政府是设计了很多培训的，拿了大量的这个资金来做什么来做培训，做教育，包括农民的一些因为它涉及到民宿要接待，大巴山森林人家要接待，比如说一些插花，一些小的一些微景观的打照等等这些自己来做房间的布置等等这样的一些培训。 所以他这个是我觉得这样的话他是来可以保证他这个就是可持续发展这里面的贫困等等。\n讲者1：第二个就是这个案例它是否是可以复制？ 其实这个我觉得应该是没有什么问题的，因为现在其实三变改革其实是我不知道其他地方。 重庆市去年前年的时候，重庆就选了三十一个试点村作为全市的四级试点村。 到今年的时候，我们重庆乡村振兴十大行动里面已经明确了全市所有的村要进行三遍改革。 为什么呢？ 因为三边改革其实它是做资源深化，也就是唤醒就是这个我们的激活我们的沉默资源，包括这个沉默资源，其实包括沉默资源。\n讲者1：沉淀资源其实包括我们国家这几年大家看得到在脱贫攻坚里面大量的投入的什么呢？ 基础设施我们很多村庄其实如果是按照这个投入来算的话，很多村庄国家是投了很多的钱的基础设施的。 但是这部分基础设施如何来让它变现呢？ 如何让它从沉睡资源或者沉没成本变成变激活它其实就是刚才比如说我们谈到活到那个案例，活到其实就是政府投钱修了，那么个活到修了那么个步道，其实就是修了之后也没发挥好的作用，结果进入市场主体来做旅游开发等等这些来激活它说这个其实是我觉得是一个前提，三变改革它是个前提，因为这个是现在国家他也是努力在推的一个事情，我觉得这样的他其实是可以。 我觉得是可以复制的，我觉得这个是我就做这么多回应。 谢谢。 谢谢。 谢谢。\n讲者2：要提问肖教授的来福利。\n讲者1：Ok 。\n讲者3：那个好，我觉得假如肖老师昨天安排是跟那个温温培训老师一起，可能我觉得更整合，因为昨天温培训老师谈的都是整个框架。 对吧，从大的所谓的顶层设计的角度，那么你今天做了个报告，这是个具体对吧，它的一个所谓的生态资源的资本化，他的具体的运作或者怎么样对吧？ 所以刚才看到他比如从乡镇府里面设立这么惨却人中心，然后还有这个合作社对吧，如何来入股，然后到具体他的运作会怎么样？ 那么这里也可能是一个很关键的问题，就是说在你们做那个能力建设这个过程当中，无论是对于这个包括咱们在这个些中关的那个顶层先进？ 对于老百姓这个合作社的社员对？ 川民他怎么样能够体现他作为这个社员，对于这个所谓的合作社，让他把这个资源对吧都拿出来，被这个合作对吧，合作以后再变成属于一个所谓的这种产权的这个交换对吧？ 所以怎样的一个治理这个能力你们是采取什么方法来去加强他的一个无论是从设计上还是从能力建设上能够更好来做到这个这方面的。 所以能够达到我们现在说的如何来共建对共治还有这个共享的这样的一个那个一一个机制好。\n讲者1：谢谢陆老师。 其实谈到这一部分的，其实大家都知道，其实这个就昨天文老师提的一个概念叫三级市场。 其实我们现在做的集体经济组织其实还是个一级市场。 就一级市场里面最难的就是刚才陆老师谈到的比如说我们资源如何定价的问题。 对因为现在我们农村很多资源它是非标性的，它不像城市资源，那么有可以标注可以那个的，而它是非标性，怎么来定价呢？ 其实南流都在第一步。\n讲者1：第一步在是比如说集体经济组织成立以后，组织起来之后，把村民组织起来之后，要反复地去跟村民讨论。 比如说这栋楼我们村委会这栋楼到底定多少钱？ 当时是怎么一个情况？ 这是反复地开会，其实", "acc_len": 2.3197278911564627}

Since 1996 there have been over 45 of the A2100 based satellites launched, with over 400 years of total on-orbit service.\nOther A2100 spacecraft include JCSAT-13 and VINASAT-2, which were launched May, 2012 on an Ariane 5 rocket, as well as Arabsat-6A and Hellas Sat 4/SaudiGeoSat-1 of Saudi Arabia's Arabsat-6G program.In 2002, Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems was given a Frost and Sullivan Satellite Reliability Award for excellence in the production of flexible and reliable communications satellites used in geosynchronous Earth orbit.A2100 customers includes communications companies around the world, including Astra, Telesat, SKY Perfect JSAT Group and others.\n\nDesign\nThe Lockheed Martin A2100 geosynchronous spacecraft series is designed for a variety of telecommunications needs including Ka band broadband and broadcast services, fixed satellite services in C-band and Ku band payload configurations, high-power direct broadcast services using the Ku band frequency spectrum, and mobile satellite services using UHF, L-band and S-band payloads.The A2100 satellite system was developed by the Astro Space team at its East Windsor, New Jersey facility, with team members delivering a flexible common bus with fewer components, lower spacecraft weight, and reduced customer delivery time.The A2100 is being supplanted by the LM2100, an evolutionary upgrade with several new features. The military version is the LM2100 Combat Bus.\n\nPropulsion system\nThe attitude control system includes reaction wheels, with momentum desaturation and main motor maneuver attitude control propulsion provided by small monopropellant hydrazine motors. This hydrazine supply is contained in a central propellant tank of 0.90 m diameter and up to 2.00 m length depending on the customer's requirements.\nThis tank's maximum length was later increased to 2.55 m.\nThe liquid apogee engine uses hydrazine fuel from the central tank along with nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer from two flanking tanks of 0.54 m diameter and up to 1.65 m long.\nOrbit maintenance is performed by the small hydrazine motors and ion thrusters.\nThe maximum propellant supply (with the largest tanks at 95% fill factor) are 1368 kg of hydrazine fuel and 627 kg of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer.\nAccording to Moog-ISP, the A2100 platform uses its LEROS bipropellant Liquid Apogee Engine.\n\nSatellite orders\nA2100A\nA2100AX\nA2100AXS\nA2100M (Military)\nLM2100 (Modernized)\nLM2100M (Modernized Military)\nCancelled orders\nPassage 2:\nCommunications satellite\nA communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications.  Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbit 22,300 miles (35,900 km) above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite. Others form satellite constellations in low Earth orbit, where antennas on the ground have to follow the position of the satellites and switch between satellites frequently.\nThe high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth.  The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points.  Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or \"bands\" certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\nIn October 1945, Arthur C. Clarke published an article titled \"Extraterrestrial Relays\" in the British magazine Wireless World. The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary orbits to relay radio signals. Because of this, Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the concept of the communications satellite, and the term 'Clarke Belt' is employed as", "acc_len": 2.334164588528678}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage:\nThuluth\nThuluth ( sols, Turkish: Sülüs, from  ' \"one-third\") is a script variety of Islamic calligraphy invented by Ibn Muqlah Shirazi. The straight angular forms of Kufic were replaced in the new script by curved and oblique lines. In Thuluth, one-third of each letter slopes, from which the name (meaning \"a third\" in Arabic) comes. An alternative theory to the meaning is that the smallest width of the letter is one third of the widest part. It is an elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. Various calligraphic styles evolved from Thuluth through slight changes of form.\n\nHistory\n\nThe greatest contributions to the evolution of the Thuluth script, occurred during Ottoman Empire in three successive steps that Ottoman Art Historians call \"calligraphical revolutions\":\n\n*The first revolution occurred in the 15th century and was initiated by the Master Calligrapher Şeyh Hamdullah.[http://www.kalemguzeli.net/huseyin-kutlu-hat-sanati-kalemi-sevk-edebilmektir.html Hüseyin Kutlu: Hat sanatı kalemi şevk edebilmektir - Kalem Güzeli][http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00xcallig/mughalearly/zzturkey/hamdullah1500s.html hamdullah1500s]\n*The second revolution resulted from the work of the Ottoman calligrapher Hâfız Osman in the 17th century.[http://www.istanbul.edu.tr/Bolumler/guzelsanat/kitap.htm Kitap Sanatı] \n*Finally, in the late 19th century, Mehmed Şevkî Efendi gave the script the distinctive shape it has today.[http://sanattarihi.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/mehmed-sevki-efendi-2/ Mehmed Şevki Efendi « Sanat Tarihi] [http://www.turkislamsanatlari.com/sevkiefendi.asp Türk Ýslam Sanatlarý - Tezyini Sanatlar]\n\nArtists\n\nThe best known artist to write the Thuluth script at its zenith is said to be Mustafa Râkım Efendi (1757–1826), a painter who set a standard in Ottoman calligraphy which many believe has not been surpassed to this day.[http://calligrapher.blogsome.com/2006/04/20/rakim-mustafa-rakim-1757-1826/ Journal of Ottoman Calligraphy :: RAKIM: “Mustafa Rakim” (1757 - 1826) :: April :: 2006]\n\nUsage\n\nThuluth was used to write the headings of surahs, Qur'anic chapters. Some of the oldest copies of the Qur'an were written in Thuluth. Later copies were written in a combination of Thuluth and either Naskh or Muhaqqaq. After the 15th century Naskh came to be used exclusively.\n\nThe script is used in the Flag of Saudi Arabia where its text, Shahada al Tawhid, is written in Thuluth.\n\nStyle\n\nAn important aspect of Thuluth script is the use of harakat (\"hareke\" in Turkish) to represent vowel sounds and of certain other stylistic marks to beautify the script. The rules governing the former are similar to the rules for any Arabic script. The stylistic marks have their own rules regarding placement and grouping which allow for great creativity as to shape and orientation. For example, one grouping technique is to separate the marks written below letters from those written above.\n\nScripts developed from Thuluth\n\nSince its creation, Thuluth has given rise to a variety of scripts used in calligraphy and over time has allowed numerous modifications. Jeli Thuluth was developed for use in large panels, such as those on tombstones. Muhaqqaq script was developed by widening the horizontal sections of the letters in Thuluth. Naskh script introduced a number of modifications resulting in smaller size and greater delicacy. Tevki is a smaller version of Thuluth .\n\nRuq'ah was probably derived from the Thuluth and Naskh styles, the latter itself having originated from Thuluth.\nQuestion:\nThe script of Thuluth, a variety of Islamic calligraphy, is seen on the flag of what country?\nAnswer:\nSaudia Arabia\nPassage:\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nAmazon - definition of Amazon by The Free Dictionary\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/Amazon\n (ăm′ə-zŏn′, -zən)\nn.\n1.

A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War.\n\nFollowing the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea.\n\nAlthough he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Paragraph 1: The Sisters of Charity were the first Order of Nuns to be established in Australia with their convent being founded at Parramatta in 1838. In the late 1890s the Sisters of Charity were seeking to found an order in the Blue Mountains to provide a place of respite for exhausted nuns \"where they might find fresh vigour for God's work\". It was also noted that there was no Catholic school in or near Katoomba, hence there was an opportunity for the nuns to regain their health and energy whilst conducting their appointed work. The Sisters rented a small cottage close to the Catholic Church and Presbytery in Katoomba and moved in in 1900. A new college called Mount St Mary's opened on the main Street of Katoomba in 1901, and in 1903 Mother Mary Eulalia was appointed Rectress of the college. The Mount St Mary's premises in town eventually proved inadequate for the rapidly increasing student base, so, in 1907, it was decided to purchase substantial acreage to the north of the railway station on which to build a brand new boarding house for girls and convent accommodation for the Sisters. Bridget McGuigan, Julia O'Connor and Helena Bourke of the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity (but denominated on the title deeds as spinsters) purchased the subject site (Lots 26 - 35) from Frank Grimley (The Grimley Subdivision) on 10 June 1907. The site included the cottage known as \"The Rocks\" (designed by Varney Parkes for John Fletcher M.A.) which was located in the south west corner of the site. The cottage and the lands the Sisters were to purchase are associated with Fletcher who had established a boarding college for boys in the mid 1880s called Katoomba College (later known as the Priory and then The Royal Palace) which was located on the opposite side of the road to where St Mary's now stands. Fletcher had purchased additional lands (future St Mary's lands) presumably to provide land for sporting activities, however, the depression of the 1890s led to the closure of his college and the sale of Lots 26 - 35 to Frank Grimley. When the Sisters made their purchase the land had largely been cleared and was characterised by open paddock with the exception of a number of mature eucalypts and \"The Rocks\". The following year on 24 June 1908, an additional  were purchased from Frank Grimley adding orchards and vegetable gardens to an already spacious landscape.\n\nParagraph 2: On 18 December 2012, it was announced that the Welsh Government was interested in buying the airport from its current owners. In 2012, the Airport faced sustained criticism from the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones. On 28 February 2012, Jones announced to the Welsh Assembly: \"We would like to see many routes emerging from Cardiff Airport, but the Airport must get its act together... Last week, I went to the Airport and the main entrance was shut. People could not go in through the main entrance; they had to go through the side entrance. It is important that the Airport puts itself in a position where it is attractive to new airlines, and, unfortunately, that is not the case at present.\" His criticism led to accusations that he was \"talking down\" Cardiff Airport whilst aviation industry professionals commented that he was unqualified to make such comments. However, Jones returned to this theme on 7 March 2012 saying, \"With the condition of the Airport at the moment I would not want to bring people in through Cardiff Airport because of the impression it would give of Wales...I have to say the time has come now for the owners of the Airport to decide to run the Airport properly or sell it.\"\n\nParagraph 3: The final plan was to land soldiers from navy ships on the Lebanese coast who would infiltrate into Beirut disguised as tourists, where they would be picked up by Mossad agents waiting for them with rented cars and driven to their targets. Some of the commandos were to be disguised as women (Barak was disguised as a brunette woman). This was at the suggestion of Elazar, who was concerned that a group of men moving through Beirut at midnight would raise suspicion. In addition to the assassination mission, four PLO facilities were to be attacked. To maintain the element of surprise, the apartments of the three targets would have to be breached before the other attacks could begin. Before the mission, the forces trained using similar apartments in northern Tel Aviv. They also practiced cross-dressing and walking around disguised as lovers. Meanwhile, Mossad agents in Beirut gathered additional intelligence for the raid. Nielsen selected the private beach of the Sands Hotel as the landing site since access was restricted to guests and it was close to the hotel's parking lot, where the commandos could be picked up by Mossad agents.

Synth-pop duo La Roux and Scottish indie-rock quartet Glasvegas are also hotly tipped.\nAmong the lesser-known artists are south London rapper Speech Debelle and art-rock trio the Invisible, while eccentric quintet Led Bib and folk group Sweet Billy Pilgrim make up the more leftfield nominations.\nTypically for the Mercury prize, the omissions are as surprising as the artists that made the final cut. Both Lily Allen (who was also overlooked for her 2006 debut album Alright, Still) and Manchester group Doves were rumoured to be odds on to win, but neither have been nominated.\nThe Mercury prize was established in 1992 as an alternative to the more commercially minded Brit awards. A panel of industry experts, including journalists, musicians and independent-label executives, debate the merits of what they believe to be the finest British albums from the past year, regardless of sales or radio play. Previous winners include Portishead, PJ Harvey and Arctic Monkeys.\nBut the Mercury prize's reputation as an awards ceremony that celebrates quality over sales has come in for a bashing in recent years as the prize itself grows in stature. \"I think there's a tendency for a knee-jerk negative reaction to the Mercury nominations – to see what's not on the list, what they've missed out,\" said the Guardian's chief pop critic Alexis Petridis. \"The whole concept behind the shortlist is really nebulous. Is it artistic endeavour? Or is it a degree of commercial success, because there's certainly never any outright commercial flops on the list?\" Petridis continues: \"There's not a vast amount in the way of dance or urban music, nor are there artists with any kind of lengthy history. I'm not sure what happened to Manic Street Preachers' nomination, but there you go.\"\nAs for Lily Allen and that phantom nomination, the singer has already taken to her Twitter page to say, \"I hope La Roux wins\".\nThe winner of this year's award will be announced on 8 September 2009.\nNominations for the Mercury prize 2009 (with odds from bookmaker William Hill)\nFlorence and the Machine – Lungs 5/1\nKasabian – West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum 5/1\nBat for Lashes – Two Suns 6/1\nLa Roux – La Roux 6/1\nQuestion:\nWhose album Two Suns was nominated for the 2009 Mercury Music Prize?\nAnswer:\nBat for lashes\nPassage:\nKettlebell Circuits for MMA, BJJ, and Martial Arts ...\nKettlebell Circuits for MMA, BJJ, and Martial Arts | Breaking Muscle\nKettlebell Circuits for MMA, BJJ, and Martial Arts\nCoach\n        \nIt is very easy to get lost in the moment during the tense theater of battle while watching a Brazilian jiu jitsu competition", "acc_len": 2.3790523690773067}

However, the underlying epigenetic and/or transcriptional mechanisms are largely unknown, and dissection of specific pathways in cultured cells may contribute to filling this gap. We have previously shown that, in mammalian cells, deprivation of essential AAs (methionine/cysteine or tyrosine) leads to the transcriptional reactivation of integrated silenced transgenes, including plasmid and retroviral vectors and latent HIV-1 provirus, by a process involving epigenetic chromatic remodeling and histone acetylation. Here we show that the deprivation of methionine/cysteine also leads to the transcriptional upregulation of endogenous retroviruses, suggesting that essential AA starvation affects the expression not only of exogenous non-native DNA sequences, but also of endogenous anciently-integrated and silenced parasitic elements of the genome. Moreover, we show that the transgene reactivation response is highly conserved in different mammalian cell types, and it is reproducible with deprivation of most essential AAs. The General Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase and the downstream integrated stress response represent the best candidates mediating this process; however, by pharmacological approaches, RNA interference and genomic editing, we demonstrate that they are not implicated. Instead, the response requires MEK/ERK and/or JNK activity and is reproduced by ribosomal inhibitors, suggesting that it is triggered by a novel nutrient-sensing and signaling pathway, initiated by translational block at the ribosome, and independent of mTOR and GCN2. Overall, these findings point to a general transcriptional response to essential AA deprivation, which affects the expression of non-native genomic sequences, with relevant implications for the epigenetic/transcriptional effects of AA restriction in health and disease.\nCopyright: © 2018 De Vito et al.

In particular, studies in yeast, animal models and humans have shown that reduced food intake, reducing either overall calories, or only sugars, proteins, or even single amino acids (AA), such as Methionine (Met), may extend lifespan and healthspan, and reduce the risk of cancer and other age-related diseases [3–9]. In addition, fasting or specific AA deprivation have shown potential therapeutic applications, owing to their ability to directly reduce the growth of some tumor types [10, 11], sensitize cancer cells to chemo- or immunotherapy [12, 13], and allow efficient hematopoietic stem cell engraftment . However, little is known about the specific processes and molecular mechanisms mediating the roles of nutrient restriction in human health and longevity.\nA properly balanced diet in metazoans contains optimal amounts of a subset of AA, which cannot be synthetized de novo and are therefore named essential amino acids (EAAs).

It now is only forested in some wooded areas, such as Radnor Wood, though a fairly large area of forest exists on the Wales–England border north of Anchor (the planted Ceri Forest).\n\nThe ancient Offa's Dyke runs north-south through the area (and can be walked by the Offa's Dyke Path).\n\nIt is a deanery of the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford. \n\nA Shropshire Lad \n\nA.

The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded.  In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple tongue and groove are used.\n\nTongue and groove is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with wood, in flooring, parquetry, panelling, and similar constructions. Tongue and groove joints allow two flat pieces to be joined strongly together to make a single flat surface. Before plywood became common, tongue and groove boards were also used for sheathing buildings and to construct concrete formwork.\n\nEach piece has a slot (the groove) cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the tongue) on the opposite edge. The tongue projects a little less than the depth of the groove. Two or more pieces thus fit together closely. The joint is not normally glued, as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off.\n\nIn another assembly method, the pieces are end-matched. This method eliminates the need for mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on 16 inch or 24 inch centres of conventional framing.\n\nFor many uses, tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality.  Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in platform framing is often supplied with tongue and groove edges.\n\nWhen joining thicker materials, several tongue and groove joints may be used one above the other.\n\nMethods\n\nOne of the following woodworking tools may be used to produce the tongue and groove:\n* A four- or six-head moulder (for large quantities)\n* A wood shaper (spindle moulder)\n* A circular saw bench\n* Suitable hand planes: a plough plane for the groove and a tongue plane for the tongue, or a combination plane\n* A spindle router\n\nTongue-in-groove\n\nTongue-in-groove is similar to tongue and groove, but instead of the tongue forming part of one of the edges, it is a separate, loose piece that fits between two identically grooved edges. The tongue may or may not be of the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. For example, plywood flooring is commonly grooved at the edges, and plastic tongues are used to form the joint.\nQuestion:\nA tongue and groove joint is used when working with what material?\nAnswer:\nDiffuse-porous wood\nPassage:\nSenegal\nSenegal (;   ), officially the Republic of Senegal (), is a country located in West Africa.

He also held several positions during 14 years at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. From 2013 to 2014 he served as Chairman of the Nominating Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention.\nPassage 2:\nMidwestern Baptist Theological Seminary\nMidwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (MBTS) is a Private Baptist seminary in Kansas City, Missouri. It is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary also houses an undergraduate college, Spurgeon College (formerly known as Midwestern College).\n\nHistory\nMidwestern Seminary was officially founded on May 29, 1957, when the Southern Baptist Convention voted to establish the institution and elected a board of trustees. Since that time, the trustees have been regularly and exclusively elected by the Southern Baptist Convention. Under the leadership of the original board of trustees, the seminary was established in 1958 in northern Kansas City, Missouri, with six faculty members and 136 students. Most of the property on which the seminary is housed was donated by the Vivion family; the Vivion farmhouse has been restored and is now the official residence of the seminary's presidential family.Doctrinally, MBTS is guided by the Baptist Faith and Message 2000. Every member of the faculty and administration is required to sign a statement agreeing to the precepts of this document. While students are required to be Christians, they are not required to affirm the Baptist Faith and Message 2000. The purpose statement of Midwestern Seminary was revised in 2008 to read, \"Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary serves the church by biblically educating God-called men and women to be and to make disciples of Jesus Christ.\"\nJason K. Allen was installed as president in 2012 and began revitalization. The seminary almost tripled in size in the next five years, becoming one of the fastest-growing seminaries in North America and one of the largest in the world. Enrollment has nearly tripled in five years, from 1,107 in the 2010–2011 academic year to surpassing 3,000 students in 2017–2018.The seminary was granted an exception to Title IX in 2016 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons.\n\nCampus\nMidwestern Seminary is located in Kansas City, Missouri, at the intersection of Vivion Rd. and N. Oak Trafficway, a few minutes from downtown. A new 1,000 seat auditorium, The Daniel Lee Chapel, was dedicated in April 2014. Other recent improvements to the campus include the O.S. Hawkins Courtyard and the Charles Spurgeon Library.\nThe campus includes dormitory and apartment buildings for residential students, playground and picnic areas, a modest fishing pond, and over 220 acres of woods. The Sword & Trowel Bookstore is also located on campus.\nIn 2016, the seminary announced plans to build a new Student Center on the north slope of the campus, using a $7 million lead gift by the Mathena family of Oklahoma City. Construction on this project—which includes a gymnasium, fitness center, faculty offices, cafeteria, coffee shop, bookstore, and expanded study center, and which includes exterior plans for sports fields—concluded in 2018. The 40,000 square foot center opened for the Fall 2018 semester.\n\nThe Spurgeon Center and Library\nThe Spurgeon Library houses the remaining personal collection of Charles Spurgeon, which Midwestern Seminary acquired from William Jewell College in 2006. The dedication of the library took place in October 2015, and the Seminary is now working to digitize the collection and publish new volumes of previously undiscovered sermons. Geoff Chang serves as the curator of the collection, which also includes artifacts from Spurgeon's life and ministry, among them his personal writing desk, travel kit, and the metalwork from his study door. The library interior is appointed in academic \"Oxford style\" and includes portraits highlighting the life of Spurgeon commissioned by Christian T. George and Midwestern Seminary of the Romanian artist Petru Botezatu.\n\nFor The Church\nSince Allen's installation as president of Midwestern Seminary, the institution has emphasized \"For The Church\" as its vision statement for academic and institutional renewal, seeking to re-connect the purpose of theological education to the support and strengthening of local churches. This vision has been manifested in numerous events and resources, including Midwestern's website For The Church and the annual For The Church national conference held in Kansas City, which has featured internationally renowned speakers Matt Chandler, H.B. Charles Jr., Russell Moore, David Platt, and Ray Ortlund Jr.\n\nAcademics\nMBTS is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools", "acc_len": 2.3915211970074814}

Furthermore, the quasi one-dimensional geometry of SWNTs allows for defining tunable p-n junctions induced by electrostatic doping through local gates~\\cite{Buchs_JAP,tunable_pn_2011}. Combining a well-defined QD within such a p-n junction structure could constitute a crucial building-block for the realization of highly desirable electrically driven, on-demand single photon emitters operating at telecom wavelength, based $e.g.$ on a turnstile device architecture~\\cite{turnstile_1994,turnstile_1999}.\nIn practice, QDs in carbon nanotubes have been reported predominantly for two different confinement structures: i) Engineered tunneling barriers at metal-nanotube contacts~\\cite{Pablo04nat} and/or by gate electrodes, used \\emph{e.g.} to manipulate single electron spins~\\cite{Laird:2015}, ii) Unintentional localization potentials stemming from environmental disorder~\\cite{Hofmann_2016}, allowing for single-photon emission mediated by localization of band-edge excitons to QD states~\\cite{CNT_photonics,Hoegele_2008,Walden_Newman_2012,Hofmann_2013,Pernice_2016_2}. Both types of structures are usually operated at cryogenic temperature due to small energy scales ranging from a few to few tens of millielectronvolts.\n\\\\\n\\indent Another technique for achieving confinement in SWNTs makes use of artificial defects such as covalently bound oxygen or aryl functionalization groups on the side walls of semiconducting SWNTs, inducing deep exciton trap states allowing for single-photon emission at room temperature~\\cite{Htoon_2015,tunable_QD_defects}. Also, carrier confinement between defect pairs acting as strong scattering centers has been reported for mechanically induced defects~\\cite{Postma_SET} as well as for ion-induced defects with reported level spacings up to 200 meV in metallic SWNTs~\\cite{Buchs_PRL}. The latter technique, combined with recent progress in controlling defects structure and localization~\\cite{Robertson_2012,Yoon_2016,Laser_writing_2017} offers a high potential for engineering a broad set of SWNT-based quantum devices operating at room temperature. \n\\\\\n\\indent Here, we demonstrate confinement of electrons and holes in sub-10 nm QD structures defined by ion-induced defect pairs along the axis of semiconducting SWNTs. Using low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), bound states with level spacings of the order of 100 meV and larger are resolved in energy and space. By solving the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation over a piecewise constant potential model, the effects of asymmetric defect scattering strength as well as the influence of the Au(111) substrate such as terrace edges on the bound states structure are remarkably well reproduced. By means of ab-initio calculations based on density functional theory and Green's functions, we find that single (SV) and double vacancies (DV) as well as chemisorbed nitrogen ad-atoms are good candidates to produce QDs with the experimentally observed features. These simulations also allow to study the scattering profile as a function of energy for different defect combinations.\n\n\\section{Experimental section}\n\nThe experiments have been performed in a commercial (Omicron) low temperature STM setup operating at $\\sim5$~K in ultra high vacuum. Topography images have been recorded in constant current mode with a grounded sample, using mechanically cut Pt/Ir tips. Differential conductance $dI/dV$ spectra, proportional in first approximation to the local density of states (LDOS)~\\cite{Tersoff85} have been recorded using a lock-in amplifier technique. The LDOS spatial evolution along a nanotube axis is obtained by $dI/dV(x,V)$ maps built by a series of equidistant $dI/dV", "acc_len": 2.396508728179551}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nAbusive language refers to any type of insult, vulgarity, or profanity that debases the target; it also can be anything that causes aggravation BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 . Abusive language is often reframed as, but not limited to, offensive language BIBREF2 , cyberbullying BIBREF3 , othering language BIBREF4 , and hate speech BIBREF5 .\nRecently, an increasing number of users have been subjected to harassment, or have witnessed offensive behaviors online BIBREF6 . Major social media companies (i.e. Facebook, Twitter) have utilized multiple resources—artificial intelligence, human reviewers, user reporting processes, etc.—in effort to censor offensive language, yet it seems nearly impossible to successfully resolve the issue BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 .\nThe major reason of the failure in abusive language detection comes from its subjectivity and context-dependent characteristics BIBREF9 . For instance, a message can be regarded as harmless on its own, but when taking previous threads into account it may be seen as abusive, and vice versa. This aspect makes detecting abusive language extremely laborious even for human annotators; therefore it is difficult to build a large and reliable dataset BIBREF10 .\nPreviously, datasets openly available in abusive language detection research on Twitter ranged from 10K to 35K in size BIBREF9 , BIBREF11 . This quantity is not sufficient to train the significant number of parameters in deep learning models. Due to this reason, these datasets have been mainly studied by traditional machine learning methods. Most recently, Founta et al. founta2018large introduced Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter, a dataset containing 100K tweets with cross-validated labels. Although this corpus has great potential in training deep models with its significant size, there are no baseline reports to date.\nThis paper investigates the efficacy of different learning models in detecting abusive language. We compare accuracy using the most frequently studied machine learning classifiers as well as recent neural network models. Reliable baseline results are presented with the first comparative study on this dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of different features and variants, and describe the possibility for further improvements with the use of ensemble models.\nRelated Work\nThe research community introduced various approaches on abusive language detection. Razavi et al. razavi2010offensive applied Naïve Bayes, and Warner and Hirschberg warner2012detecting used Support Vector Machine (SVM), both with word-level features to classify offensive language. Xiang et al. xiang2012detecting generated topic distributions with Latent Dirichlet Allocation BIBREF12 , also using word-level features in order to classify offensive tweets.\nMore recently, distributed word representations and neural network models have been widely applied for abusive language detection. Djuric et al. djuric2015hate used the Continuous Bag Of Words model with paragraph2vec algorithm BIBREF13 to more accurately detect hate speech than that of the plain Bag Of Words models. Badjatiya et al. badjatiya2017deep implemented Gradient Boosted Decision Trees classifiers using word representations trained by deep learning models. Other researchers have investigated character-level representations and their effectiveness compared to word-level representations BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 .\nAs traditional machine learning methods have relied on feature engineering, (i.e. n-grams, POS tags, user information) BIBREF1 , researchers have proposed neural-based models with the advent of larger datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks have been applied to detect abusive language, and they have outperformed traditional machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression and SVM BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . However, there are no studies investigating the efficiency of neural models with large-scale datasets over 100K.\nMethodology\nThis section illustrates our implementations on traditional machine learning classifiers and neural network based models in detail. Furthermore, we describe additional features and variant models investigated.\nTraditional Machine Learning Models\nWe implement five feature engineering based machine learning classifiers that are most often used for abusive language detection. In data preprocessing, text sequences are converted into Bag Of Words (BOW) representations, and normalized with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) values. We experiment with word-level features using n-grams ranging from 1 to 3, and character-level features from 3 to 8-grams. Each classifier is implemented with the following specifications:\nNaïve Bayes (NB): Multinomial NB with additive smoothing constant 1\nLogistic Regression (LR): Linear LR with L2 regularization constant 1 and limited-memory BFGS optimization\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM): Linear SVM with L2 regularization constant 1 and logistic loss function\nRandom Forests (RF): Averaging probabilistic predictions of 10 randomized decision trees\nGradient Boosted Trees (GBT): Tree boosting with learning rate 1 and logistic loss function\nNeural Network based Models\nAlong with traditional machine learning approaches, we investigate neural network", "acc_len": 2.399002493765586}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage:\nAdam's apple\nThe laryngeal prominence (commonly referred to as Adam's apple), a feature of the human neck, is the lump or protrusion that is formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx.\n\nStructure\n\nThe structure of the laryngeal prominence forms a bump under the skin. It is larger in adult men, in whom it is usually clearly visible and palpable. In women, the bump is much less visible and is hardly perceived on the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. \n\nThe meeting point of the two portions of the cartilage generally forms an acute angle (of about 90°) in men, while in women it forms an open arc (of about 120°).\n\nSex difference\n\nAlthough both sexes have it, the Adam's apple is considered to be a characteristic feature of adult men, because its size tends to increase considerably during puberty. \n\nIts development is considered a secondary sexual characteristic of males that appears as a result of hormonal activity. Its level of development varies among individuals and the widening of that area in the larynx can occur very suddenly and quickly.\n\nThe laryngeal prominence is more prominent in adult males than in females because of the difference in the size of the angle: 90° in males and 120° in females.\n\nFunction \n\nThe Adam's apple, in conjunction with the thyroid cartilage which forms it, helps to protect the walls and the frontal part of the larynx, including the vocal cords (which are located directly behind it). It is found in both women and men.\n\nAnother function of the laryngeal prominence is related to the deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal prominence grows in size mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation apparatus and, as a result, the man gets a deeper voice note.  \n\nSociety and culture\n\nCosmetic surgery to reduce the size of laryngeal prominence is called chondrolaryngoplasty (thyroid chondroplasty).  The surgery is effective, such that complications tend to be few and, if present, transient. \n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are two main theories as to the origin of the term \"Adam's apple\". \nThe \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" and the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary point at an ancient belief that a piece of forbidden fruit was embedded in Adam's throat (the first man, according to Abrahamic religions).  However, neither the Bible nor other Judeo-Christian Islamic writings mention such a story. In fact, the biblical story does not even specify the type of fruit that Adam ate. \n\nLinguist Alexander Gode claimed that the Latin phrase to designate the laryngeal prominence was very probably translated incorrectly from the beginning. The phrase in Latin was \"pomum Adami\" (literally: 'Adam's apple'). This, in turn, came from the Hebrew \"tappuach ha adam\" meaning \"apple of man\". The confusion lies in the fact that in Hebrew language the proper name \"Adam\" (אדם) literally means \"man\", while the late Hebrew word used to refer  \"bump\" is very similar to the word used to refer \"apple\".   Proponents of this version contend that the subsequent phrases in Latin and other Romance languages represent a mistranslation from the start. \n\nThe medical term \"prominentia laryngea\" was introduced by the Basle Nomina Anatomica in 1895. \n\nIn the American South, goozle is used colloquially to describe the Adam's apple, likely derived from guzzle.    \n\nAdditional images\n\nFile:Slide9lll.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nFile:Slide5mmm.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nFile:Slide7ooo.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nQuestion:\nWhat is the common name for the laryngeal prominence in the body?\nAnswer:\nAdams Apple\nPassage:\nUranophobia\nFear of heaven, also known by its Greek-derived name uranophobia or ouranophobia, is a phobia that makes its sufferer fear heaven or the sky. \n\nThe origin of the word urano is Greek, meaning heaven, while phobia is Greek for fear.\n\nCauses\n\nThe causes of Uranophobia, as with other phobias, can be linked to a combination of external events and internal susceptibility - of brain chemistry and life experiences.\n\nFear of heaven may more specifically be related to the dread of punishment in the afterlife.  Psychoanalysis would see this as an animistic projection of the threatening and punitive powers of the parents  - heaven or the sky being a relatively late stage in the detachment of the superego from the actual parents. \n\nJewish tradition\n\nJewish tradition highly valorised the fear of heaven, seeing it as a positive force linked both to wisdom and to personal humility. \n\nLiterary examples\n\nW.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nSince humans amass more and more generally available data in the form of unstructured text it would be very useful to teach machines to read and comprehend such data and then use this understanding to answer our questions. A significant amount of research has recently focused on answering one particular kind of questions the answer to which depends on understanding a context document. These are cloze-style questions BIBREF0 which require the reader to fill in a missing word in a sentence. An important advantage of such questions is that they can be generated automatically from a suitable text corpus which allows us to produce a practically unlimited amount of them. That opens the task to notoriously data-hungry deep-learning techniques which now seem to outperform all alternative approaches.\nTwo such large-scale datasets have recently been proposed by researchers from Google DeepMind and Facebook AI: the CNN/Daily Mail dataset BIBREF1 and the Children's Book Test (CBT) BIBREF2 respectively. These have attracted a lot of attention from the research community BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 with a new state-of-the-art model coming out every few weeks.\nHowever if our goal is a production-level system actually capable of helping humans, we want the model to use all available resources as efficiently as possible. Given that\nwe believe that if the community is striving to bring the performance as far as possible, it should move its work to larger data.\nThis thinking goes in line with recent developments in the area of language modelling. For a long time models were being compared on several \"standard\" datasets with publications often presenting minuscule improvements in performance. Then the large-scale One Billion Word corpus dataset appeared BIBREF15 and it allowed Jozefowicz et al. to train much larger LSTM models BIBREF16 that almost halved the state-of-the-art perplexity on this dataset.\nWe think it is time to make a similar step in the area of text comprehension. Hence we are introducing the BookTest, a new dataset very similar to the Children's Book test but more than 60 times larger to enable training larger models even in the domain of text comprehension. Furthermore the methodology used to create our data can later be used to create even larger datasets when the need arises thanks to further technological progress.\nWe show that if we evaluate a model trained on the new dataset on the now standard Children's Book Test dataset, we see an improvement in accuracy much larger than other research groups achieved by enhancing the model architecture itself (while still using the original CBT training data). By training on the new dataset, we reduce the prediction error by almost one third. On the named-entity version of CBT this brings the ensemble of our models to the level of human baseline as reported by Facebook BIBREF2 . However in the final section we show in our own human study that there is still room for improvement on the CBT beyond the performance of our model.\nTask Description\nA natural way of testing a reader's comprehension of a text is to ask her a question the answer to which can be deduced from the text. Hence the task we are trying to solve consists of answering a cloze-style question, the answer to which depends on the understanding of a context document provided with the question. The model is also provided with a set of possible answers from which the correct one is to be selected. This can be formalized as follows:\nThe training data consist of tuples INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is a question, INLINEFORM2 is a document that contains the answer to question INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 is a set of possible answers and INLINEFORM5 is the ground-truth answer.

Three manufacturers were represented in LMP1, including a duo of cars entered by Audi Sport Team Joest, Toyota and Porsche. Kazuki Nakajima was not available to drive the No. 7 Toyota TS040 Hybrid because of a Super Formula commitment and was replaced by IndyCar Series driver Mike Conway. After spending the last three months recovering from a heavy crash during practice for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Loïc Duval returned to Audi Sport Team Joest after doctors granted him medical clearance. The Kodewa-backed Lotus team moved up from the LMP2 category with their new CLM P1/01 but missed the first three races because the new car was not ready. In the month before its debut, Lotus named Super GT competitor James Rossiter, experienced sports car driver Christophe Bouchut and Formula Three European Championship race winner Lucas Auer as the trio to pilot the No. 9 car. Rebellion Racing was the other representative of the LMP1 privateer teams.LMP2 consisted of four cars with twelve drivers. United SportsCar Championship participants Extreme Speed Motorsports debuted in the World Endurance Championship with a HPD ARX 03B-Honda driven by the team's regular drivers Scott Sharp, Ryan Dalziel and Ed Brown. Tsugio Matsuda returned from his four-month hiatus from prototype car racing and joined Matthew Howson and Richard Bradley in driving the No. 47 KCMG Oreca 03R-Nissan.

His U.S. hits included \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" (1971), and his reputation as a Northern soul artist in the UK was secured by \"A Little Piece of Leather\", a performance highlighting his powerful falsetto voice.\n\nCareer\nElbert was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but when aged three his family relocated to Buffalo, New York. He learned to play guitar and piano as a child, and in 1955 formed a doo-wop group, the Vibraharps, with friend Danny Cannon. Elbert acted as the group's guitarist, songwriter, arranger, and background vocalist, making his recording debut on their single \"Walk Beside Me\". He left the group in 1957 for a solo career, and recorded a demonstration record that earned him a recording contract with the King label's DeLuxe subsidiary. His solo debut \"What Can I Do?\" reached #12 in the U.S. R&B chart, and he followed it up with the less successful \"Believe It or Not\" and \"Have I Sinned?\", which became a regional hit in Pittsburgh.He continued to release singles on DeLuxe, but with little commercial success, and also played New York's Apollo Theater and toured the Chitlin' Circuit of African-American owned nightclubs. After completing an album, The Sensational Donnie Elbert Sings, he left DeLuxe in 1959, joining first Red Top Records, where in 1960 he recorded \"Someday (You'll Want Me to Want You)\", and then Vee-Jay Records, where he had another regional hit with \"Will You Ever Be Mine?\", which reportedly sold 250,000 copies in the Philadelphia area but failed to take off nationwide. His career was also interrupted by a spell in the US Army, from which he was discharged in 1961. He then recorded singles for several labels, including Parkway, Cub and Checker, but with little success. However, although the 1965 Gateway label release of \"A Little Piece of Leather\" failed to chart in the US, the record became a #27 pop hit when released on the London label in the UK several years later in 1972, and remains a Northern soul favorite.Elbert relocated to the UK in 1966, where he married. There, he recorded \"In Between The Heartaches\" for the Polydor label in 1968, a cover version of the Supremes' hit \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" and an album of Otis Redding cover versions, Tribute To A King. His 1969 Deram release \"Without You\" had a rocksteady rhythm, and went to the top of the Jamaican charts.\nHe returned to the US the same year and had his first US chart hit in over a decade with the Rare Bullet release, \"Can't Get Over Losing You\", which reached #26 on the Billboard R&B chart. The track and its b-side, \"Got To Get Myself Together\", both written by Elbert, were released several times on different labels in subsequent years. After the success of that record, Elbert moved labels for a re-make of the Supremes' 1964 hit, \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" on All Platinum. It became his biggest hit, reaching #15 on the Billboard pop chart, #6 on the R&B chart, and (in 1972) #8 in the UK. Its follow-up, \"Sweet Baby\" reached #30 on the R&B chart in early 1972.\nElbert then signed with Avco-Embassy, where he entered the recording studio with the successful production team of Hugo & Luigi. His cover of the Four Tops' \"I Can't Help Myself\" reached #14 on the Billboard R&B chart, but climbed as high as #2 on the alternative Cashbox R&B chart. Elbert baulked at the label's insistence that he record material associated with Motown and departed with only a few tracks left to record for an album. Even so, the album was released after Avco sold it on to a budget label, Trip.\nHe returned to All Platinum and had a run of minor R&B hits, but left after a disagreement over the claimed authorship of Shirley & Company's R&B chart-topper \"Shame Shame Shame\", which was credited to label owner Sylvia Robinson. Elbert was also involved in a copyright wrangle over Darrell Banks' major R&B and pop hit in 1966, \"Open The Door To Your Heart\". He had originally written the song as \"Baby Walk Right In\" (still its alternative legal title) and given it to Banks, but received no", "acc_len": 2.423940149625935}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>The inventories of the selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in our review totaled 2,823 aircraft and required approximately $20 billion to operate and support in fiscal year 2016. The inventory, aircraft status, initial operational capability, and service life forecast for each of the 12 selected fixed-wing aircraft are shown in figure 1. Sustainment of fixed-wing aircraft and other weapon systems comprises the logistics and personnel services required to maintain and prolong operations, and DOD policy provides direction to service components on sustainment planning across the life cycle of the weapon system. Specifically, DOD policy requires the services to develop and implement a sustainment strategy, such as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, for sustaining its weapon systems. According to DOD’s policy, this strategy should be the basis for all sustainment efforts, including sustainment metrics mapped to key performance parameters and key system attributes, such as aircraft availability, to manage sustainment performance. The policy states that, after initial operating capability, programs should update the sustainment plan whenever there are major changes to its strategy for sustaining the weapon system, or every 5 years, whichever occurs first. The Air Force and the Navy also have guidance that implements the requirements of the DOD guidance. These services’ guidance include sustainment-planning requirements for life-cycle sustainment and assurance of affordability. There are a variety of DOD offices that have roles and responsibilities related to sustaining fixed-wing aircraft. For instance, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD ), is the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense for all matters concerning acquisition and sustainment. Specifically, USD (A&S) is responsible for establishing policies for logistics, maintenance, and sustainment support for all elements of DOD, including fixed-wing aircraft. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness (ASD ) serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the USD (A&S) on logistics and materiel readiness within DOD. Specifically, the ASD (L&MR) is responsible for (1) establishing DOD policies and procedures for logistics, maintenance, materiel readiness, strategic mobility, and sustainment support; (2) providing related guidance to the Secretaries of the military departments, including developing the Life- cycle Sustainment Plan outline; and (3) monitoring and reviewing programs associated with these areas, among other duties and responsibilities. For the Air Force, the Air Force Materiel Command develops, acquires, and sustains weapon systems through research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, maintenance, and program management of the systems and their components. This command provides acquisition and life-cycle management services and logistics support, among other things. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center within the Air Force Materiel Command is responsible for the life-cycle management of weapon systems from inception to retirement. A Program Executive Officer—responsible for managing a specific portfolio of weapon systems—is responsible for each of the selected fixed-wing aircraft. The Program Executive Officer oversees the program office that manages each weapon system. For the Navy and Marine Corps, the Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for providing the full life-cycle support of naval aviation aircraft, weapons, and systems. This support includes research, design, development and systems engineering; acquisition; test and evaluation; training facilities and equipment; repair and modification; and in-service engineering and logistics support. As with the Air Force, Program Executive Officers oversee their assigned program managers. DOD relies on program managers to lead the development, delivery, and sustainment of individual weapon systems through their life cycles. The program managers are the designated individuals with responsibility for and authority to accomplish the program’s sustainment objectives to meet the users’ operational needs. Product support managers, who work within the program offices, are responsible for developing and implementing support strategies for weapon systems that maintain readiness and control life-cycle costs. Weapon systems are sustained under various arrangements that may include contractors, DOD organic facilities, or some combination of the two. For example, the Air Force Sustainment Center provides depot maintenance through its Air Logistics Complexes for weapon systems. Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for the Navy Fleet Readiness Centers, which provide depot-level maintenance for Navy and Marine Corps fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, the Air Force Sustainment Center and the Navy Supply Systems Command, as well as the Defense Logistics Agency, manage inventories of repair parts, and individual weapon systems programs are typically supported by a complex supplier network that includes a prime contractor, subcontractors, and various tiers of parts suppliers. On the other hand, sustainment responsibilities—in their entirety or particular elements—may be contracted out as part of a public-private partnership or a performance-based logistics agreement, such as with the F-22 Raptor. The Air Force and Navy monitor the readiness status of selected fixed- wing aircraft through numerous performance metrics. Specifically, the Air Force measures how well a fleet is performing by calculating the availability of the fleets’ aircraft, which is the number of aircraft that are available for flight operations. The Navy measures its aircraft availability through two metrics:", "acc_len": 2.428927680798005}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nRecently, deep learning algorithms have successfully addressed problems in various fields, such as image classification, machine translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech generation and other machine learning related areas BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . Similarly, substantial improvements in performance have been obtained when deep learning algorithms have been applied to statistical speech processing BIBREF3 . These fundamental improvements have led researchers to investigate additional topics related to human nature, which have long been objects of study. One such topic involves understanding human emotions and reflecting it through machine intelligence, such as emotional dialogue models BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 .\nIn developing emotionally aware intelligence, the very first step is building robust emotion classifiers that display good performance regardless of the application; this outcome is considered to be one of the fundamental research goals in affective computing BIBREF6 . In particular, the speech emotion recognition task is one of the most important problems in the field of paralinguistics. This field has recently broadened its applications, as it is a crucial factor in optimal human-computer interactions, including dialog systems. The goal of speech emotion recognition is to predict the emotional content of speech and to classify speech according to one of several labels (i.e., happy, sad, neutral, and angry). Various types of deep learning methods have been applied to increase the performance of emotion classifiers; however, this task is still considered to be challenging for several reasons. First, insufficient data for training complex neural network-based models are available, due to the costs associated with human involvement. Second, the characteristics of emotions must be learned from low-level speech signals. Feature-based models display limited skills when applied to this problem.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a model that uses high-level text transcription, as well as low-level audio signals, to utilize the information contained within low-resource datasets to a greater degree. Given recent improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology BIBREF7 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , speech transcription can be carried out using audio signals with considerable skill. The emotional content of speech is clearly indicated by the emotion words contained in a sentence BIBREF10 , such as “lovely” and “awesome,” which carry strong emotions compared to generic (non-emotion) words, such as “person” and “day.” Thus, we hypothesize that the speech emotion recognition model will be benefit from the incorporation of high-level textual input.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that simultaneously utilizes audio and text data in recognizing emotions from speech. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 68.8% to 71.8% when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, which is one of the most well-studied datasets. Based on an error analysis of the models, we show that our proposed model accurately identifies emotion classes. Moreover, the neutral class misclassification bias frequently exhibited by previous models, which focus on audio features, is less pronounced in our model.\nRelated work\nClassical machine learning algorithms, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), support vector machines (SVMs), and decision tree-based methods, have been employed in speech emotion recognition problems BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . Recently, researchers have proposed various neural network-based architectures to improve the performance of speech emotion recognition. An initial study utilized deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract high-level features from raw audio data and demonstrated its effectiveness in speech emotion recognition BIBREF14 . With the advancement of deep learning methods, more complex neural-based architectures have been proposed. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models have been trained on information derived from raw audio signals using spectrograms or audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and low-level descriptors (LLDs) BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . These neural network-based models are combined to produce higher-complexity models BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , and these models achieved the best-recorded performance when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset.\nAnother line of research has focused on adopting variant machine learning techniques combined with neural network-based models. One researcher utilized the multiobject learning approach and used gender and naturalness as auxiliary tasks so that the neural network-based model learned more features from a given dataset BIBREF20 . Another researcher investigated transfer learning methods, leveraging external data from related domains BIBREF21 .\nAs emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, researchers have also investigated the combination of acoustic features and language information, built belief network-based methods of identifying emotional key phrases, and assessed the emotional salience of verbal cues from both phoneme sequences and words BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 .

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers is seeking to recover about $973,000 in costs from a high profile gender discrimination trial that captivated Silicon Valley, according to a court filing on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ellen Pao leaves San Francisco Superior Court Civic Center Courthouse during a lunch break in San Francisco, California March 25, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jury cleared Kleiner Perkins in March of claims it short-circuited former partner Ellen Pao’s career because she is a woman. The trial helped spark a wide discussion about gender at the center of the U.S. technology industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner has offered to waive its legal costs should Pao choose not to appeal, according to firm spokeswoman Christina Lee. Kleiner’s costs request includes about $865,000 in expert witness fees, the court filing said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,” Lee said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao and her legal team are considering the proposal, said Heather Wilson, a spokeswoman for Pao. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao, now interim chief executive at social-news service Reddit, claimed her standing at Kleiner Perkins crumbled after she ended a brief affair with a partner. Her career deteriorated after he and Kleiner Perkins started retaliating against her in a climate that was overall unfriendly toward women, her lawyers argued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the verdict, three jurors told Reuters they had focused on Pao’s increasingly negative performance reviews, which undermined her argument that she deserved to be promoted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner’s offer to withdraw its costs request in exchange for an end to the case, is common when defendants prevail in employment lawsuits. Should Pao decide to pursue an appeal, her case would be heard by California’s First District Court of Appeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Westlaw data, out of 49 decisions involving discrimination and retaliation over the past two years, the First District affirmed 26 of 31 cases where the employer won in the trial court, or 84 percent. Only five cases were reversed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile the court, which covers San Francisco and 11 other Northern California counties, handed victory to employers in more than half of the cases they lost in the lower courts, reversing 10 of 18 cases.\nPassage 2:\nSAN FRANCISCO — Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm, is offering a new deal to the former associate who unsuccessfully sued the firm, accusing it of gender discrimination: Promise not to pursue this case any further or pay us $1 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The offer was made in papers filed this week in California Superior Court in San Francisco. The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition and court reporter costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the winning party, Kleiner is asking the former associate, Ellen Pao, to reimburse it for these bills. But if she forgoes any appeal and lets the case die, the firm will forgive and forget, or at least move on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,” said Christina Lee, a Kleiner spokeswoman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jury at the end of March rejected all of Ms. Pao’s claims. Legal fees, which must have been considerable on both sides, are not on the table. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms. Pao’s chief lawyer, Alan Exelrod, did not return a call for comment. Ms. Pao has not said whether she will pursue an appeal, and the grounds on which she would do so are uncertain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge in the case, Harold Kahn, made no obvious rulings that seemed to favor the defense. If anything, the opposite was true. He declined to allow testimony about Ms. Pao’s husband, Alphonse Fletcher Jr., whose hedge fund is bankrupt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Debra S. Katz, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who specializes in gender discrimination suits, said Kleiner sounded a little punitive.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact federal entities and the information they maintain. According to OMB’s 2018 annual FISMA report to Congress, agencies reported 35,277 information security incidents to DHS’s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) in fiscal year 2017. As shown in figure 1, these incidents involved threat vectors, such as web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and the loss or theft of computer equipment, among others. These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The following examples highlight the impact of such incidents: In March 2018, the Department of Justice reported that it had indicted nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to the department, the Iranians allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 U.S. companies, and 5 federal government agencies, among other entities. In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated that, since at least March 2016, Russian government actors had targeted U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors. In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management reported that an intrusion into its systems had affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a separate but related incident had compromised its systems and the files related to background investigations for at least 21.5 million individuals. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is prescribed by federal law and policy. FISMA sets requirements for effectively securing federal systems and information. In addition, the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires protecting federal networks through the use of federal intrusion prevention and detection capabilities. Further, Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, directs agencies to manage cybersecurity risks to the federal enterprise by, among other things, using the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (cybersecurity framework). FISMA was enacted to improve federal cybersecurity and clarify government-wide responsibilities. The law is intended to provide for improved oversight of federal agencies’ information security programs. Specifically, the law provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets. The law is also intended to ensure the effective oversight of information security risks, including those throughout civilian, national security, and law enforcement agencies. FISMA assigns OMB and DHS oversight roles in ensuring federal agencies’ compliance with the law. Among other things, FISMA requires OMB to develop and oversee the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies, except with regard to national security systems. The law also assigns OMB the responsibility of requiring agencies to identify and provide information security protections commensurate with assessments of risk to their information and information systems. The law further requires DHS to administer the implementation of agency information security policies and practices for non-national security information systems, in consultation with OMB, by developing, issuing, and overseeing implementation of binding operational directives; monitoring agency implementation of information security policies and practices; and convening meetings with senior agency officials to help ensure their effective implementation of information security policies and practices, among other things. FISMA assigned to NIST the responsibility for developing standards and guidelines that include minimum information security requirements. To this end, NIST has issued several publications to provide guidance for agencies in implementing an information security program. For example, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 provides guidance to agencies on the selection and implementation of information security and privacy controls for systems. FISMA also assigns to the head of each executive branch agency, responsibility for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. The law also delegates to the agency chief information officer (CIO), or comparable official, the authority to ensure compliance with FISMA requirements. The CIO is responsible for designating a senior agency information security officer whose primary duty is information security. In addition, the law requires agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to secure federal information systems. Specifically, these information security programs are to provide risk-based protections for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency. Further, FISMA requires agencies to comply with DHS binding operational directives, OMB policies and procedures, and NIST federal information processing standards. FISMA also has reporting requirements for OMB and federal agencies. Specifically, OMB is to report annually, in consultation with DHS, on the effectiveness of agency information security policies and practices", "acc_len": 2.4364089775561095}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Paragraph 1: In 2008 Ohio experienced an unintended consequence of a new statute that resulted in a brief period of overlap voting, when absentee voting has started and before the close of voter registration.  This period ran from September 30 until October 6, due to the newly instituted early voting policy. On August 13, 2008, Brunner ordered county election board officials to establish procedures to enable voters who register to be immediately issued an absentee ballot.  Because a voter could show up with only a cell phone bill, give any four digits and claim they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number, and then immediately vote and have such ballots put into the same pool as other votes with no procedure for more rigorous scrutiny of their validity, the Republican Party opposed the same day voting plan and fought it in several Ohio Courts. Ohio Republican Party officials and Republican voters argued in separate lawsuits that Ohio law requires voters to be registered for 30 days before they cast an absentee ballot. On September 29, 2008 (a day after lower state and federal courts overruled GOP objections to same-day registration and voting or GOP requests for mandated ballot segregation and verification) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio rejected Republican efforts to stop the plan. United States district court judge James Gwin in Cleveland, Ohio also ruled against the Republicans and issued a restraining order to enforce Brunner's plan. In Columbus, Ohio, U.S. District Judge George Smith declined to rule on another statewide challenge, deferring to the state Supreme Court's decision. The rulings, which opened a window to register and vote on the same day until the absentee ballot deadline on October 6, 2008, was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision in which two Republican jurists who were on the November 2008 ballot recused themselves and were replaced by one Republican and one Democrat by Chief Justice Thomas Moyer.  The normal roster of Ohio Supreme Court jurists is all Republican and the lone Democrat replacement, William H. Wolff Jr., cast the tie-breaking vote.  The dissenters noted that Ohio's Constitution requires that a person register to vote 30 days in before voting. Brunner ordered segregation of same-day-registration ballots and verification of them before counting them on Election Day, November 4, 2008.  In related proceedings on September 30, 2008, Judge Smith of The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Columbus had granted an Ohio Republican Party request for a restraining order that would mandate election observers during early voting.  Brunner prevailed in the appellate court which ruled that the district court \"abused its discretion\" in granting the restraining order.\n\nParagraph 2: Throughout 1990, the KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound which they dubbed \"stadium house\". Songs from The White Room soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled \"Additional Communicators\"), a sample-heavy pop-rock production and crowd noise samples. The first \"stadium house\" single, \"What Time Is Love? (Live from Trancentral)\", released in October 1990, reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart and hit the top-ten internationally. The follow-up, \"3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)\", was an international top-five hit in January 1991, reaching #1 in the UK and #5 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The album The White Room followed in March 1991, reaching #3 in the UK. A substantial reworking of the aborted soundtrack, the album featured a segued series of \"stadium house\" songs followed by downtempo tracks.The KLF's chart success continued with the single \"Last Train to Trancentral\" hitting number two in the UK, and number three on the Eurochart Hot 100. In December 1991, a re-working of a song from 1987, \"Justified & Ancient\" was released, featuring Tammy Wynette. It was another international hit – peaking at number two in the UK, and number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 – as was \"America: What Time Is Love?\", a hard, guitar-laden reworking of \"What Time Is Love?\". In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by Depeche Mode (\"Policy of Truth\"), the Moody Boys (\"What Is Dub?\"), and Pet Shop Boys (\"So Hard\" from the Behaviour album, and \"It Must Be Obvious\"). Neil Tennant described the process: \"When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I had to go and sing the vocals again, they did it in a different way. I was impressed that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Wizard, at different", "acc_len": 2.4364089775561095}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nJohn Macklin\nJohn Farrell \"Big John\" Macklin (October 17, 1883 – October 10, 1949) was an American football player, coach of football, basketball, baseball and track and field, and a college athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Michigan Agricultural College, now Michigan State University from 1911 to 1915. With a five-year record of 29–5, he has the highest winning percentage of any football coach in Michigan State history. Macklin coached the Michigan State Spartans football team to its first ever victories over Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Penn State. He was also the athletic director at Michigan Agricultural and coached the school's basketball, baseball, and track and field teams. Macklin tallied marks of 48–38 as head basketball coach (1910–1916) and 52–27 as head baseball coach (1911–1915).\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nMacklin was born in Worcester, Massachusetts and attended Worcester High School. He played high school football for four years and was also the captain of Worcester's crew. After graduating from Worcester High School, Macklin attended Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire and then St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, playing football at each school.\n\nPenn\nAfter completing his preparatory education, Macklin enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. Macklin grew to be a giant of a man for his time. He was 6 feet, 7 inches tall and weighed 275 pounds. When Macklin arrived at Penn, one account indicates there were no uniforms large enough to fit him: \"When the big husky appeared on the gridiron the first thing the coaches did was to send for the athletic outfitter, for there was not a suit on the campus that would encompass his frame.\" Macklin played two years at the tackle position for Penn's football team. The Chicago Daily Tribune later wrote: \"For a big man he was remarkably agile and his tackling on the wings and his quickness in getting through to break up plays was the delight of the coaches.\"\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1910, Macklin coached football at a boys' school at Pawling, New York. Macklin's success at Pawling brought him to the attention of Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University), which was in need of a new athletic director and coach. He was hired in January 1911 upon the recommendation of the renowned Penn athletic trainer Mike Murphy. Macklin was the head coach at Michigan State 1911 to 1915 and compiled a record of 29–5. His winning percentage of .853 is the highest in the history of the Michigan State Spartans football program. Macklin's 1913 Michigan State team finished with an undefeated, untied record of 7–0 and outscored opponents by a combined score of 180 to 28. Macklin was the first Michigan State coach to lead the Spartans to football victories over Ohio State (35–20 in 1912), Michigan (12–7 in 1913), Wisconsin (12–7 in 1913), and Penn State (6–3 in 1914). Macklin's 1913 team was also the first racially integrated team in the school's history, as Gideon Smith became the first African-American player for the Spartans.Macklin was also the athletic director and coach of the baseball, men's basketball, and track and field teams. He coached the basketball team from 1910 to 1916 and compiled a 48–38 (.558) record, including a 12–3 record for 1911–12 season. He coached the baseball team from 1911 to 1915, compiling a record of 52–27 (.658).Macklin retired from coaching in March 1916 to enter the coal mining business in Pennsylvania.\n\nLater years and honors\nThe Associated Press in 1949 called Macklin \"the founding father of the big time at Michigan State College.\" When he was hired in 1911, the school was putting on games for $200. When he left, the school received guarantees of $10,000 for games. As athletic director, he also led the effort to build new athletic buildings and a modern gymnasium. In 1935, Michigan State renamed its football stadium Macklin Field in his honor. At the time, Macklin was a coal mine operator living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The name was changed to Macklin Stadium in 1948, and in 1957, Macklin's name was dropped and replaced by the current name, Spartan Stadium.Macklin died at his home in the suburbs of Philadelphia at age 65.\n\nHead coaching record\nFootball\nPassage 2:\nDon Coleman (offensive tackle)\nDon Edwin Coleman (May 4, 1928 – January 30, 2017) was an American football player.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>As reported by the United Nations, the International Criminal Police Organization, and other organizations, wildlife trafficking networks span the globe. These organizations have attempted to measure the value of illegally traded wildlife, but available estimates are subject to uncertainty. In 2016, for example, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reported that various sources estimated the global scale of illegal wildlife trade to be from $7 billion to $23 billion annually. UNEP also estimated that the scale of wildlife crime has increased in recent years in part based on a rise in environmental crime. U.S. trade in wildlife and related products includes a variety of species, such as live reptiles, birds, and mammals, as well as elephant ivory, according to law enforcement reports and government and nongovernmental officials. FWS and NOAA data on wildlife products seized at U.S. ports provide examples of the diversity of illegally traded plants, fish, and wildlife imported into or exported from the United States. For example, from 2007 to 2016, the top 10 plant, fish, and wildlife shipments seized nationally by FWS were coral, crocodiles, conchs, deer, pythons, sea turtles, mollusks, ginseng, clams, and seahorses. During that time, FWS reported that more than one-third of the wildlife shipments it seized were confiscated while being imported from or exported to Mexico (14 percent), China (13 percent), or Canada (9 percent). FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices are responsible for enforcing certain laws and treaties prohibiting wildlife trafficking. FWS Office of Law Enforcement. This office enforces certain U.S. laws and regulations as well as treaties prohibiting the trafficking of terrestrial wildlife, freshwater species, and birds. Among other things, the office aims to prevent the unlawful import, export, and interstate commerce of foreign fish and wildlife, as well as to protect U.S. plants, fish, and wildlife from unlawful exploitation. As of fiscal year 2016, the office had a budget of $74.7 million and employed 205 special agents to investigate wildlife crime, including international and domestic wildlife trafficking rings. Most of these special agents report to one of eight regional offices, which receive national oversight, support, training, and policy guidance from the FWS Office of Law Enforcement headquarters. The office’s headquarters houses a special investigative unit focused on conducting complex, large- scale criminal investigations of wildlife traffickers. In addition, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement has deployed special agents to serve as international attachés at seven U.S. embassies. These attachés provide countertrafficking expertise to embassy staff, work with host government officials to build law enforcement capacity, and contribute directly to casework or criminal investigations of wildlife traffickers. According to FWS data, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement opened more than 7,000 investigations on wildlife trafficking and other illegal activities in fiscal year 2016, including nearly 5,000 cases involving Endangered Species Act violations and nearly 1,500 cases involving Lacey Act violations. FWS Office of Law Enforcement investigations have disrupted wildlife trafficking operations. For example, Operation Crash—an ongoing rhino horn and elephant ivory-trafficking investigation launched in 2011—has led to over 30 convictions and more than $2 million in fines. NOAA Office of Law Enforcement. This office enforces certain U.S. laws and regulations as well as treaties prohibiting the trafficking of marine wildlife, including fish, as well as anadromous fish. Among other things, the office aims to prevent the illegal, unregulated, and unreported harvesting and trade of fish as well as the trafficking of protected marine wildlife. As of fiscal year 2016, the office had a budget of $68.6 million and employed 77 special agents to investigate wildlife crimes within its jurisdiction. These agents report to one of five regional offices, and those offices receive national oversight, support, and policy guidance from the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement headquarters. According to NOAA data, the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement initiated more than 5,000 investigations in fiscal year 2016. About half of those investigations involved violations of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended, and some of the 5,000 investigations involved violations of the Endangered Species Act or the Lacey Act. NOAA Office of Law Enforcement investigations have disrupted wildlife trafficking operations. For example, in fiscal year 2016, a NOAA Office of Law Enforcement investigation led to the conviction of a company and five individuals for illegally trafficking whale bone carvings, walrus ivory carvings, black coral carvings, and other products derived from protected species into the United States. The FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices collaborate with other government agencies and organizations to combat wildlife trafficking. Both agencies work with other federal, state, and tribal law enforcement officers as well as their international counterparts as needed during wildlife trafficking investigations. For example, FWS and NOAA work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,", "acc_len": 2.4613466334164587}

In contrast to the “interesting” story behind her name, Monaliza lived an unpleasant upbringing, which made her grow her anti-social attitude and most importantly an extreme inability to draw a smile. Now, 37 years old, and after 17 years of waiting for her turn to come in the long queue of applicants, Monaliza finally gets a governmental job at the Directorate of Archiving and makes a decision that it's time for her to go out into the world. This makes Afaf (Haifa Al Agha), her older unmarried agoraphobic sister who wants to keep Monaliza by her side, very unhappy. At the same time their outgoing neighbour, Rodaina(Suha Najjar), is trying to marry Monaliza off to her sleazy, older and still unwed brother, Suhail(Haidar Kfouf). Monaliza, fed up by Afaf constantly controlling her life, She tricks her into thinking that she is actually considering the proposal. In the office Monaliza meets Nayfeh (Nadera Omran), a bossy, prejudiced, disagreeable woman who keeps picking on everybody around and especially Hamdi (Shady Khalaf), the cheerful Egyptian cafeteria guy, who keeps trying to loosen her up with his coffee and jokes. Monaliza who's been living in an emotional ice cube for a long time, gradually opens up to Hamdi's charm and little by little lets him into her closed world and start to learn the joy of living. When Hamdi finally manages to draw a smile on Monaliza's face, things start getting complicated; Hamdi's work permit is expiring and he'll soon become “illegal”. On the other hand, Monaliza's trick backfires and suddenly everyone in the neighbourhood think that she is officially engaged to Suhail. Being socially inexperienced, and not wanting to lose the battle with Afaf, Monaliza doesn't know what to do about that neither she tells Hamdi about it. Until one day, after a big fight with Nayfeh in the office, Hamdi impulsively decided to show up at Monaliza's neighbourhood to meet her sister and propose, only to hear that Monaliza is already “engaged” to the grocer, Suhail. Feeling shocked and betrayed, Hamdi decides to go back to Egypt immediately and Monaliza thinks she must have lost him forever. But when Rodaina realizes the heartbreak, being a dedicated lover, she encourages Monaliza to run after him and work things out. Monaliza's story overlaps with a bunch of other characters’ who surround her; the story of her sister Afaf and what brought her to become agoraphobic, and the story of Rodaina, who is still waiting for her husband who disappeared in Iraq several years ago, and the story of Nayfeh at the office and her inexcusable bitterness.\n\nParagraph 3: Following Will's arrival in Bel-Air, he was a great distance from home and was considered an outsider by many people in his Bel-Air neighborhood.

Prior to appearing in The Bill he had already played the high-profile role of nightclub owner, Don Watkins, in the soap opera Coronation Street. He also made appearances in a number of other TV shows, including the first series of Starting Out, Boon, Minder, Dear John, Farrington of the F.O., Dempsey and Makepeace, Z-Cars, Andy Capp, Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Blake's 7 and Casualty. His film credits included roles in Trial by Combat (1976), Britannia Hospital (1982), Don't Open till Christmas (1984) and Link (1986).\n\nLloyd was one of the most popular members of the television show, The Bill. In 1996, the show won the award for \"Best TV Drama\" at the National Television Awards and it was Lloyd who collected it on behalf of the cast and crew. His Welsh-born father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was himself a police officer who was killed in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. \n\nA chronic alcoholic, he played \"Tosh\" continuously from 1988 until he was sacked from The Bill in 1998 for his lack of punctuality and failing to learn his lines. Within days, he was admitted to a clinic in Burton upon Trent for detoxification and was administered Antabuse (Disulfiram), but then left the premises to drink alcohol. He returned to the clinic in an intoxicated state, retired to bed, fell asleep, then choked on his vomit. Lloyd died just one week after recording his last scenes for The Bill, and the character of Tosh was still appearing on screen for more than a month after Lloyd's death.\n\nHe had been so popular on The Bill that on 26 February 1992, within four years of joining the show, he was selected as special guest for the TV guest show This Is Your Life. \n\nHe was the brother of ITN reporter Terry Lloyd who was killed in the Iraq War in 2003.

After winning four more League championships and two FA Cups, the club experienced a post-Second World War lull until a revival in the 1960s. A period of sustained success came in the mid-1980s, when Everton won a further two League championships, one FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.\nThe club's supporters are colloquially known as \"Evertonians\" or \"Blues\". Everton's main rivals are Liverpool, whose home stadium at Anfield is just under one mile away from Everton's home at Goodison Park; the two clubs contest the Merseyside derby. Everton have been based at Goodison Park since 1892, having moved from their original home at Anfield following a disagreement over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.\n\nHistory\nEverton was founded as St. Domingo's FC in 1878 so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton, could play sport year round – cricket was played in summer. The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club. The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.The club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888–89 and won its first League Championship title in the 1890–91 season. Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again in 1914–15. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were reigning champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.\nIt was not until 1927 that Everton's first sustained period of success began. In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean from Tranmere Rovers. In 1927–28, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win its third League Championship that season. However, Everton was relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and was promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in 1931–32, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming its status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity. Everton also won its second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3–0 win against Manchester City in the final. The era ended in 1938–39 with a fifth League Championship.The outbreak of the Second World War again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Everton was relegated for the second time in 1950–51 and did not earn promotion until 1953–54, when it finished as the runner-up in its third season in the Second Division. The club has been a top-flight presence ever since.\nEverton's second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961. In 1962–63, his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship. In 1966 the club won the FA Cup with a 3–2 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Everton again reached the final in 1968, but this time was unable to overcome West Bromwich Albion at Wembley. Two seasons later in 1969–70, Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals Leeds United. During this period, Everton was the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions – covering the seasons from 1961–62 to 1966–67.However, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors", "acc_len": 2.478802992518703}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>DOD’s MILCON appropriations are used to fund the acquisition, construction, installation, and equipping of temporary or permanent public works, military installations, facilities, and real property needed to support U.S. military forces in the United States and overseas. As with other DOD activities, no funds may be appropriated in any fiscal year or obligated or expended for MILCON activities unless such funds have been specifically authorized by law. Each year, the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes amounts to be appropriated in each of the 18 programmatic MILCON appropriations accounts. Individual or conference committee reports accompanying each fiscal year’s National Defense Authorization Act provide specific congressional direction on authorized funding levels designated for specific construction projects supported by the various MILCON accounts. Similarly, conference committee reports or explanatory statements accompanying each fiscal year’s appropriations acts establish appropriated funding levels for MILCON projects. The process through which the active component requests funding for construction projects is supported by DOD’s Form 1391 Military Construction Project Data (Form 1391). The Form 1391 is to be used to support each project proposed for inclusion in the MILCON appropriations request submitted concurrently with all other DOD appropriations requests annually. The forms are to be used for both new projects as well as urgent unforeseen projects. The Form 1391 describes the scope, total project costs, and estimates of specific project elements. Costs associated with other project elements such as contingency and supervision, inspection, and design are also to be captured and included in the total requested amount. Finally, the Form 1391 is to include a description of the proposed construction and a requirements statement indicating what requirement the project provides. Project budget estimates are initially developed at the installation level and are provided to the next responsible level for review, validation, refinement, prioritization, and approval. Administrative support is to be provided when requested across the departments, but ultimately the installation is the originator and the primary responsible entity in developing the completed Form 1391. MILCON appropriations are generally available for obligation for 5 fiscal years, at which time the appropriation expires. For 5 years after they expire, appropriations are available for limited purposes, such as liquidating obligations made during the period of availability or adjusting contract costs. After these 5 years, any remaining unexpended amounts, whether obligated or unobligated, are canceled and returned to the U.S. Treasury. Once funds are returned to the U.S. Treasury, they are no longer available for any purposes. DOD obligates its appropriations throughout the period in which the appropriation is available. An “unobligated balance” is the difference between the total appropriation amount and total obligations made against the appropriated amounts. An “unexpended balance” is the total of obligated but unliquidated and unobligated amounts. According to DOD officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either rescinded by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. Reprogrammed amounts may be used to fund other projects where there are shortfalls; for projects authorized by Congress but not specifically funded through the appropriations process; for emergency projects, such as for facilities destroyed by fires. DOD’s flexibility to reprogram without congressional approval is limited by the amount to be reprogrammed to a particular project. DOD’s Financial Management Regulation requires prior congressional approval for a reprogramming that would result in an increase exceeding 25 percent of a project’s authorized base amount or $2 million, whichever is less. Prior approval is not required when established costs or project-related thresholds are not reached. According to DOD officials, reprogrammings requiring congressional approval are called “above-threshold reprogrammings” and those that do not are called “below-threshold reprogrammings.” DOD designates construction agents for the military departments and defense agencies with primary responsibility for developing and refining MILCON proposals and cost estimates, and to manage the design and construction of projects. Typically, the Army Corps of Engineers is the construction agent for Army MILCON-funded projects and the Naval Facilities Engineering Command is the construction agent for Navy and Marine Corps MILCON-funded projects. Either of those DOD entities can be the construction agent for the defense agencies and activities, such as for the Missile Defense Agency or Defense Education Activity, with the approval of the military department having jurisdiction of the real property facility. However, both the Army and the Navy may use each other’s construction agent if it is in the interest of efficiency and cost- effectiveness or when otherwise considered appropriate. The Air Force may use either the Army Corps of Engineers or Naval Facilities Engineering Command for its projects. Additionally, the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, although not a designated construction agent, reviews and approves requirements for Air Force MILCON cost estimates, and in some cases may design and construct Air Force projects where both the Air Force and the commander of the assigned construction agent agree that it is the most efficient, expeditious, and cost-effective means to complete the project.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nLanguage modelling in its inception had one-hot vector encoding of words. However, it captures only alphabetic ordering but not the word semantic similarity. Vector space models helps to learn word representations in a lower dimensional space and also captures semantic similarity. Learning word embedding aids in natural language processing tasks such as question answering and reasoning BIBREF0, stance detection BIBREF1, claim verification BIBREF2.\nRecent models BIBREF3, BIBREF4 work on the basis that words with similar context share semantic similarity. BIBREF4 proposes a neural probabilistic model which models the target word probability conditioned on the previous words using a recurrent neural network. Word2Vec models BIBREF3 such as continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) predict the target word given the context, and skip-gram model works in reverse of predicting the context given the target word. While, GloVe embeddings were based on a Global matrix factorization on local contexts BIBREF5. However, the aforementioned models do not handle words with multiple meanings (polysemies).\nBIBREF6 proposes a neural network approach considering both local and global contexts in learning word embeddings (point estimates). Their multiple prototype model handles polysemous words by providing apriori heuristics about word senses in the dataset. BIBREF7 proposes an alternative to handle polysemous words by a modified skip-gram model and EM algorithm. BIBREF8 presents a non-parametric based alternative to handle polysemies. However, these approaches fail to consider entailment relations among the words. BIBREF9 learn a Gaussian distribution per word using the expected likelihood kernel. However, for polysemous words, this may lead to word distributions with larger variances as it may have to cover various senses.\nBIBREF10 proposes multimodal word distribution approach. It captures polysemy. However, the energy based objective function fails to consider asymmetry and hence entailment. Textual entailment recognition is necessary to capture lexical inference relations such as causality (for example, mosquito $\\rightarrow $ malaria), hypernymy (for example, dog $\\models $ animal) etc.\nIn this paper, we propose to obtain multi-sense word embedding distributions by using a variant of max margin objective based on the asymmetric KL divergence energy function to capture textual entailment. Multi-sense distributions are advantageous in capturing polysemous nature of words and in reducing the uncertainty per word by distributing it across senses. However, computing KL divergence between mixtures of Gaussians is intractable, and we use a KL divergence approximation based on stricter upper and lower bounds. While capturing textual entailment (asymmetry), we have also not compromised on capturing symmetrical similarity between words (for example, funny and hilarious) which will be elucidated in Section $3.1$. We also show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the benchmark word similarity and entailment datasets in the experimental section.\nMethodology ::: Word Representation\nProbabilistic representation of words helps one model uncertainty in word representation, and polysemy. Given a corpus $V$, containing a list of words each represented as $w$, the probability density for a word $w$ can be represented as a mixture of Gaussians with $C$ components BIBREF10.\nHere, $p_{w,j}$ represents the probability of word $w$ belonging to the component $j$, $\\operatorname{\\mathbf {\\mu }}_{w,j}$ represents $D$ dimensional word representation corresponding to the $j^{th}$ component sense of the word $w$, and $\\Sigma _{w,j}$ represents the uncertainty in representation for word $w$ belonging to component $j$.\nObjective function\nThe model parameters (means, covariances and mixture weights) $\\theta $ can be learnt using a variant of max-margin objective BIBREF11.\nHere $E_\\theta (\\cdot , \\cdot )$ represents an energy function which assigns a score to the pair of words, $w$ is a particular word under consideration, $c$ its positive context (same context), and $c^{\\prime }$ the negative context. The objective aims to push the margin of the difference between the energy function of a word $w$ to its positive context $c$ higher than its negative context $c$ by a threshold of $m$. Thus, word pairs in the same context gets a higher energy than the word pairs in the dissimilar context. BIBREF10 consider the energy function to be an expected likelihood kernel which is defined as follows.\nThis is similar to the cosine similarity metric over vectors and the energy between two words is maximum when they have similar distributions. But, the expected likelihood kernel is a symmetric metric which will not be suitable for capturing ordering among words and hence entailment.\nObjective function ::: Proposed Energy function\nAs each word is represented by a mixture of Gaussian distributions, KL divergence is a better choice of energy function to capture distance between distributions. Since, KL divergence is minimum when the distributions are similar and maximum when they are dissimilar, energy function is taken as exponentiated negative KL divergence.\nHowever,", "acc_len": 2.491271820448878}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage:\nVictory in Europe Day\nVictory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. \n\nCelebrations \n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. \n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\" Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. \n\nMassive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. \n\nSoviet Victory Day \n\nAs the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a \"preliminary\" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\nCommemorative public holidays \n\n(May 8 unless otherwise stated)\n* Italy (25 April) \"Festa della Liberazione\" (Liberation Holiday).\n* Denmark (5 May) as \"Befrielsen\" (The Liberation)\n* Netherlands (5 May) as \"Bevrijdingsdag\" (Liberation Day)\n* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.\n*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nBetty Hall\nBeatrice Perin Barker Hall (March 18, 1921 – April 26, 2018) was an American politician from the state of New Hampshire. Hall served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives for a total of 28 years, serving non-consecutively from 1970 until 2008.\nHall grew up in New York City, where she attended Barnard College. In 1948, she and her husband moved to the town of Brookline, New Hampshire, where they started a textile manufacturing firm. Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, Hall began participating in local politics, serving on several boards and commissions in Brookline. Hall was elected to the Brookline school board in 1963, and in 1972, she was elected to the town board of selectmen.\nHall's career in statewide politics began in 1970 when she was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. In 1986, Hall switched her party affiliation to the Democratic Party, citing the Republican Party's shift towards conservatism during the Reagan Era. During her political career, Hall was described as a firebrand who frequently bucked her party. While a Republican, Hall was seen as a liberal member of that party, and was considered to be a political enemy by conservative leaders. In the Democratic Party, Hall was a member of the grassroots base, challenging the party's establishment in a 2007 campaign for chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\nIn the 2000s, Hall became nationally known for her activism. In 2004, she was arrested for disorderly conduct for her participation in a protest against President George W. Bush; she was later acquitted of the charge. In 2008, Hall introduced New Hampshire House Resolution 24, which would have petitioned the United States Congress to introduce articles to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their actions leading to and during the Iraq War. While the bill ultimately failed, it generated a large amount of media coverage.\n\nPre-political life and career\nEarly life and education\nBeatrice Perin Barker was born on March 18, 1921, in Koblenz, Germany, where her father Joseph Warren Barker, a United States Army officer, served as the administrator of a military district following World War I. After leaving the military, Barker's father completed his education in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving an academic position at the institution. He later became the Dean of Engineering at Columbia University, and she primarily grew up in New York City. This led to Barker's entry into academia, as her father's position at Columbia University brought prominent scientists such as Enrico Fermi and Harold Urey to their home for dinner where Barker would serve as a hostess. In 1937, her mother Mary died when Barker was 16.Barker attended the Horace Mann School and later studied engineering at Barnard College. Barker would later do graduate work at the University of New Hampshire, Boston University, and the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nFamily and career\nAfter graduating from Barnard College in 1943, Barker worked as an engineer at Western Electric. During World War II, she helped manufacture vacuum tubes for radar equipment, and her father served as a special assistant to Frank Knox, the United States Secretary of the Navy.On May 27, 1944, she married Sidney Leavitt Hall, an engineer from Concord, New Hampshire, leaving her job at Western Electric to join her husband in Ohio, where he was undergoing training with the United States Air Force in order to fight in World War II. However, the war ended before he was sent overseas, and in 1948, the couple moved to Brookline, New Hampshire, a town of 800 people in Hillsborough County. Hall's grandmother, Florence Hobart Perin, was a resident of Brookline, and Hall had frequently visited and spent several summers in the town during her youth. Sidney Hall initially worked at Textron, and in 1951, the couple started a textile manufacturing firm called Hall Manufacturing Company, which was informally known as Hall Tote Bags. The company produced stitching for dry-cleaners, as well as steam air covers for dry-cleaning machines. Later, the company became locally famous for the tote bags they produced, as well as other stitched products. Hall and her husband were members of the local Church of Christ, and she was credited with uniting the Brookline Methodist and Congregationalist churches into one single church.In 1957, Hall received a fellowship from the National Science Foundation. Hall served as the assistant manager for Hall Manufacturing Co. until 1962, whereupon she became a science and mathematics teacher in Groton, Massachusetts. Hall transferred to Fairgrounds Junior High School in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1964, and taught mathematics there until 1972. In 1968, Hall was awarded a", "acc_len": 2.506234413965087}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Paragraph 1: The Lake Causeway (Calzada del Lago in Spanish) runs north from the lake shore to the city centre, where it continues as Via 5. The total length of the causeway and the via is around . The Lake Causeway was designed to allow the rapid movement of goods and people between the city and the lake, and easy access to water. The Lake Causeway probably developed from a Middle Preclassic pathway that ran between the shore and the early settlement. The earliest version of the Lake Causeway was built in the Late Preclassic; it was about  wide and was raised  above natural ground level. The Via 5 continuation did not exist in the Late Preclassic, when the later city centre had not yet developed. During the Late Classic the causeway was further developed and extended with the formal construction of Via 5 running across the site core. The point where the two met was deliberately narrowed with the construction of flanking buildings and is likely to have been a guardpost where access to the site core was controlled. It is likely that travellers and goods arriving at the city were inspected and taxed at this control point. At its narrowest point the entrance from the causeway to Via 5 was just  wide. Parapets were erected flanking the Lake Causeway; they stood approximately  high and varied from  wide. The southern extreme of the causeway was modified with the construction of a stucco-covered platform with masonry walls defining the east and south sides. From the southern end of the causeway to the union with Via 5 there is an approximate difference in altitude of more than . There is some evidence that steps were carved from the limestone bedrock where the southern platform met the Lake Causeway. During a second phase of construction in the Late Classic, the southern platform was enlarged to measure  east-west by  north-south. The platform was supported on the south and east sides by refurbished talud walls coated in stucco. The causeway itself was redesigned as a long ramp that joined the southern platform with the city centre and the junction with Via 5. In the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) the southern end of the Lake Causeway was re-dressed with limestone fill. The stepped sides of the southern platform were filled in and covered with stone to form ramps. At about this time Stela A, a plain monument, was erected on the platform. Also in the Terminal Classic the restrictions at the north end of the causeway where it met Via 5 were removed; the whole area was levelled with finely dressed stone and mortar that left the access free for the entire width of the causeway. Ceramic remains recovered from the Lake Causeway are scarce and poorly preserved due to the strong waterflow along the incline caused during the rain season, resulting in artefacts being eroded and washed downhill towards the lake.\n\nParagraph 2: Mordashov is the son of Russian parents, who were both steel mill workers. According to Mordashov, his family used welfare coupons, allowed only 200g of butter and 400g of sausages per month. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Leningrad Engineering-Economical Institute, currently known as ENGECON. He later gained an MBA from Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 2001. In an address to students at the European University at Saint Petersburg, Mordashov spoke about his decision to study in Leningrad rather than Moscow and the value his undergraduate studies played in his search for employment and eventual career path. Returning to Cherepovets, he started his career by joining the same steel plant where his parents had worked.\n\nParagraph 3: Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the University of Cambridge with honours in Mathematics (equal Third Wrangler), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had.

It was there when the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, was fought, and remained until December 1, when it rejoined the Army of the Potomac, and passed the winter of 1864 and 1865 in doing siege duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg, Va. The Regiment was engaged in all the skirmishes that took place during this period, the most important of which were Hatcher's Run, December 10, 1864; Hatcher's Run, February 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, 1865; Fort Fisher, Va., March 25, and Fort Stedman, same day. In the attack on Petersburg, April 2, 1865, the Regiment took a prominent and important part.  The night before, the 6th Corps was massed in front of Fort Fisher, ready for the assault.  Just at daybreak, Sunday morning, the lines advanced under a heavy fire, and carried the enemy's main lines by storm.  The Second Rhode Island started in the second line, but were the first to reach the works, and planted its colors on the parapet.  The enemy fled in great confusion, after their lines were pierced.  Lieutenant Frank S. Halliday, acting Adjutant of the Regiment, with a small party, carried a rebel fort mounting two guns, and turned them upon the enemy.  The whole affair was a glorious success, and caused the evacuation of the city on Monday morning, April 3. In the Battle of Sailors' Creek, Thursday following the above, April 6, the Regiment displayed great prowess.  About 5 o'clock, P. M., the division to which it was attached, advanced on the enemy's lines, and the Second Rhode Island attacked a part of the Naval Brigade, commanded by officers of the late rebel fleet.  The Regiment charged to within a few feet of their lines, when it met a severe flank fire, which forced it to retire.  The action as so close that men were bayoneted, and knocked down with the butts of muskets.  In the confusion, the colors of the Regiment were captured, but were quickly retaken.  The place where it charged was swampy, with water at least three feet deep, but the men pushed gallantly forward, and regained all the ground lost, causing the enemy to flee in great confusion, who left a part of their wagons in Federal hands.  The loss was severe in officers and men, but there was a proud satisfaction in knowing that the efforts of the Regiment hastened the surrender of Lee and his army. Captain Charles W. Gleason and Lieutenant William H. Perry, both gallant officers, were killed.  They were loved and respected by the Regiment. They entered the service as enlisted men at the beginning of the war, and by merit rose to their positions as officers.  In this battle the conduct of officers and men was in the highest degree commendable.

In August 1915, he moved to the special group in Warsaw. Soon he became an aide-de-camp to Józef Piłsudski. In 1918, he was sent on a mission to Russia. He was given three tasks: persuade General Józef Haller's army, then in the Ukraine, to back Piłsudski (he failed in this task); reach the French military mission in Moscow under General Lavergne (he succeeded in this task); and return from Moscow to Paris to liaise with the government there. Unfortunately, he was arrested by the Soviet Cheka as a member of the Polish Military Organisation while on a French diplomatic train on its way from Moscow to Murmansk (and Paris). He was imprisoned in the Taganka prison. He was freed thanks to the intervention of his future wife, Bronisława Wieniawa-Długoszowska, with the much-feared Cheka operative Yakovleva, then in charge of the prison.

Skule became known as Skule Kongsfostre (king's foster-son), and was remembered as a remarkably intelligent and handsome man who commanded the king's hird.  He married a relative of the king, Gudrun Nevsteinsdotter, and their son was Åsolv of Rein (in Rissa), father of the lendmann Guttorm of Rein.  Guttorm's son, Bård Guttormsson of Rein, was a close friend and supporter of king Sverre Sigurdsson, fought alongside him in several battles, and was rewarded by being given the king's half-sister, Cecilia Sigurdsdotter, in marriage.  Bård and Cecilia's son Inge Bårdsson was born about the year 1185.  In 1204, when the child-king Guttorm Sigurdsson died, the two obvious candidates for the crown were Inge and his half-brother Haakon Galen, Cecilia's son by another husband.  After a struggle for power Inge was recognized as king, while Haakon retained his former command of the army.  This did not produce peace, for a faction known as the Bagler succeeded in splitting the kingdom, with Inge ruling the western half and their own candidate, Philip Simonsson, the eastern half.  Moreover, earl Haakon renewed his own claim to the crown, a claim which only lapsed with his death in 1214.  King Inge himself died in 1217.  Since 1213 the leader of the army and the hird had been Inge's half-brother Skule, a son of Bård Guttormsson by another wife, Ragnfrid Erlingsdotter, and therefore, like king Inge, fifth in descent in the male line from Tostig", "acc_len": 2.516209476309227}

They each have their own reason for hating her; Aloysius was refused bathroom privileges frequently and now has bladder problems, Philomena recalls being hit by Sister for being a poor student, Gary is there on behalf of his boyfriend Jeff, and Diane had believed Sister until her world came crashing down when her mother died of breast cancer and she was raped the same day. Diane reveals that she has brought a gun to kill Sister, something the other three were not aware of. Sister grabs a gun from behind her lectern and shoots Diane in self-defense. She also shoots Gary, proclaiming that she has sent him to heaven, as he went to confession earlier that day. She then points the gun at Aloysius, who needs to go to the bathroom, before handing it to Thomas to take a nap. The play ends with Thomas pointing the gun at Aloysius while explaining the perfections of God, Diane and Gary's dead bodies on the floor, and Sister asleep.\n\nParagraph 5: The Falcon is the nickname for two fictional detectives.

In particular, chains of magnetic atoms on SC surface have proven \nto contain self-organized Majorana quasi-particles and exotic spin textures\n\\cite{Braunecker,Klinovaja,Vazifeh,Yazdani},\nwhile hybrid DQD structures have been used to split the Cooper pairs coherently into two entangled \nelectrons propagating to separated normal leads \\cite{CPS1,CPS2,CPS4,CPS5,CPS9}.\nThe latter is possible due to non-local (\\emph{crossed}) Andreev reflections (CARs),\nin which each electron of a Cooper pair tunnels into different QD, and\nsubsequently to attached lead. Such processes give rise to an exchange mechanism \\cite{Yao},\nthat we henceforth refer to as \\emph{the CAR exchange}, which can greatly modify\nthe low-temperature transport behavior of correlated hybrid nanostructures.\n\nThe CAR exchange may be seen as RKKY-like interaction between\ntwo nearby impurities on SC surface \\cite{Yao}.\nThe effect can be understood as a consequence\nof spin-dependent hybridization of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)\nstates \\cite{Yu,Shiba,Rusinov} in SC contact,\ncaused both by the overlap of their wave functions\nand their coupling to Cooper-pair condensate.\nThis process is the most effective when the YSR states \nare close to the middle of the SC gap, {\\it e.g.} in the YSR-screened phase \\cite{YSRscreening}.\nThe mechanism presented here is essentially the same,\nyet in the considered regime can be understood\nperturbatively without referring to YSR states,\nas a consequence of the non-local pairing induced by SC electrode. \nIn particular, the presence of YSR bound states close to the Fermi level \nis not necessary for significant consequences for the Kondo physics, \nas long as some inter-dot pairing is present. \n\n\nThe proximity of SC induces pairing in QDs \\cite{RozhkovArovas,Buitelaar} \nand tends to suppress the Kondo effect if the superconducting energy gap $2\\Delta$ \nbecomes larger than the relevant Kondo temperature $T_K$ \n\\cite{Buitelaar2002Dec,adatomsSC,Kondo_vs_SC1,Kondo_vs_SC2,Zitko_Kondo-Andreev,Zitko_S-QD-N,IW_Sau,YSRscreening}.\nMoreover, the strength of SC pairing can greatly affect the Kondo physics in the sub-gap transport regime:\nFor QDs attached to SC and normal contacts, it can enhance the Kondo effect\n\\cite{DomanskiIW,KWIW,part1}, while\nfor DQD-based Cooper pair splitters, it tends to suppress both the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Kondo effects \\cite{IW_Kacper}.\nOur main result is that the non-local pairing induced by superconducting \nproximity effect, which gives rise to CAR exchange, can be the sole cause of the Kondo screening", "acc_len": 2.5286783042394014}

Data flows enable companies to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, and provide cross-border services. One study estimates that digital commerce relying on data flows drives 22% of global economic output, and that global GDP will increase by another $2 trillion by 2020 due to advances in emerging technologies. However, while cross-border data flows increase productivity and enable innovation, they also raise concerns around the security and privacy of the information being transmitted. Cross-border data flows are central to trade and trade negotiations as organizations rely on the transmission of information to use cloud services, and to send nonpersonal corporate data as well as personal data to partners, subsidiaries, and customers. U.S. policymakers are considering various policy options to address online privacy, some of which could affect cross-border data flows. For example, new consumer rights to control their personal data may impact how companies can use such data. To enable international data flows and trade, the United States has aimed to eliminate trade barriers and establish enforceable international rules and best practices that allow policymakers to achieve public policy objectives, including promoting online security and privacy. Building consensus for international rules and norms on data flows and privacy has become increasingly important as recent incidents have heightened the public's awareness of the risk of personal data stored online. For example, the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal drew attention because the firm reportedly acquired and used data on more than 87 million Facebook accounts in an effort to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the UK referendum on continued European Union (EU) membership (\"Brexit\"). In addition, security concerns have been raised about data breaches, such as those that exposed the personal data of half a million Google users or 500 million Marriot hotel customers. Organizations value consumers' personal online data for a variety of reasons. For example, companies may seek to facilitate business transactions, analyze marketing information, detect disease patterns from medical histories, discover fraudulent payments, improve proprietary algorithms, or develop competitive innovations. Some analysts compare data to oil or gold, but unlike those valuable substances, data can be reused, analyzed, shared, and combined with other information; it is not a scarce resource. However, personal data is considered personal private property. Individuals often want to control who accesses their data and how it is used. Experts suggest that data may therefore be considered both a benefit and a liability that organizations hold. Data has value, but an organization takes on risk by collecting personal data; they become responsible for protecting users' privacy and not misusing the information. Data privacy concerns may become more urgent as the amount of online information organizations access and collect, and the level of global data flows, continue to expand. Countries vary in their policies and laws on these issues. The United States has traditionally supported open data flows and has regulated privacy at a sectoral level to cover data, such as health records, rather than create a comprehensive policy. U.S. trade policy has sought to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce, including eliminating trade barriers and opening markets. Other countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade as some governments or groups seek to limit data flows outside of an organization or across national borders for a number of reasons. Blocking international data flows may impede the ability of a firm to do business or of an individual to conduct a transaction, creating a form of trade protectionism. Research demonstrates not only the economic gains from digital trade and international data flows, but also the real economic costs of restrictions on such flows. For many policymakers, the crux of the issue is: How can governments protect individual privacy in the least trade-restrictive way possible? The question is similar to concerns raised about ensuring cybersecurity while allowing the free flow of data. In recent years, Congress has examined multiple issues related to cross-border data flows and online privacy. In the 115 th Congress, congressional committees held hearings on these topics, introduced multiple bills, and conducted oversight over federal laws on related issues such as data breach notification. Members are introducing new bills and holding hearings in the 116 th Congress. Congress may consider the proposed U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and examine the digital trade chapter as an example of how to address the issues through trade agreements. In most circumstances, a consumer expects both privacy and security when conducting an online transaction. However, users' expectations and values may vary and there is no globally accepted standard or definition of data privacy in the online world. In addressing online privacy, Congress may need to define personal data and differentiate between sensitive and nonsensitive personal data. In general, data privacy can be defined by an individual's ability to prevent access to personally identifiable information (PII). According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance to federal agencies, PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual", "acc_len": 2.5286783042394014}

Since then he has guest directed on a vast number of series including CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, ER, Dollhouse and House. In 1997, Alcalá made his theatrical film directing debut with the film Fire Down Below starring Steven Seagal.\nIn 2007, Alcalá was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards for directing the Battlestar Galactica episode Exodus, Part II\n\nSelected directing credits\nPassage 2:\nLarry Alcala\nLauro \"Larry\" Zarate Alcala (August 18, 1926 – June 24, 2002) was a well-known editorial cartoonist and illustrator in the Philippines. In 2018, he was posthumously conferred the National Artist for Visual Arts title and the Grand Collar of the Order of National Artists (Order ng Pambansang Alagad ng Sining).\n\nBiography\nHe was born on August 18, 1926, to Ernesto Alcala and Elpidia Zarate in Daraga, Albay. Through a scholarship from Manila Times granted by the publisher Ramón Roces, he obtained a degree of Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1950. He became a professor at the same university from 1951 to 1981. He also received the Australian Cultural Award accompanied by a travel study grant in 1975.He started his cartooning career in 1946 while still attending school. After World War II, he created his very first comic strip, Islaw Palitaw, which was printed on the pages of the Filipino weekly magazine Liwayway. In 1947, he created the comic strip Kalabog en Bosyo, using Taglish as the medium of communication of his characters.\nHe pioneered animated cartoons for television commercials of products such as Darigold Milk in 1957 and Caltex in 1965. His campaign for the advancement of illustration and commercial art in the Philippines resulted to the establishment of the Visual Communication Department at the UP College of Fine Arts.In 1997, the Philippine Board on Books for Young People (PBBY) granted him the title Dean of Filipino Cartoonists, an achievement award for his lifetime dedication to the art of capturing humor in the character and everyday life in the Philippines. In 1991, he promoted the formation of a group of young children's book illustrators called Ang Ilustrador ng Kabataan (Ang INK).All in all, he made over 500 cartoon characters, twenty comic strips, six movies, two murals, and 15,000 published pages in his 56 years of professional cartooning career. He believed in the far-reaching role of cartoons in education and value formation.\n\nDeath\nAlcala died at the age of 75 on June 24, 2002, due to heart failure on Monday night at the Riverside Medical Centre, Bacolod City, central Philippines. His remains will lie in state at the Rolling Hills Memorial Chapel in the Visayas.\n\nHis Cartoons\nHis most popular cartoon series was Slice of Life, which is a reflection of the many unique aspects of everyday life in the Philippines. He captured the interest of his weekend patrons by giving them the task of looking for his image cleverly concealed within the weekend cartoon. He did the same with his other comic strip Kalabog en Bosyo. His cartoons had been tapped in advertising campaigns, such as corporate calendars, print ads, promotional T-shirts and in San Miguel Beer cans.In 1988, his Slice of Life received the Best in Humor award and was also cited for helping to keep alive the Filipino's ability to laugh at himself, through the lively marriage of art and humor, and through commentaries that are at once critical and compassionate, evoking laughter and reflection.Slice of Life appeared on the pages of the Weekend Magazine.\n\nMang Ambo\nMang Ambo is the personification of the Filipino according to Larry Alcala. Mang Ambo, the character, is an incorrigible cock-eyed innocent, possessing a small town charm amidst urban sophistication. Through Mang Ambo and the other characters of a fictional place called Barrio Bulabog, Alcala exposed the follies and foibles of Philippine society in general and of cosmopolitan life in particular. In this cartoon strip's characters, he also affirmed the Filipino's peculiar coping mechanism of laughing at himself in the face of adversity but still absorbing life's vic", "acc_len": 2.5311720698254363}

Hernandez, 39, was shot... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be 33 minutes before Transportation Security Administration Officer Gerardo Hernandez, who was about 20 feet from an exit, would be wheeled out by police to an ambulance, said the officials, who were briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe was still ongoing into the Nov. 1 shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all but five of those minutes, there was no threat from the suspected gunman _ he had been shot and was in custody, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it's not known when Hernandez died or if immediate medical attention could have saved his life, officials are examining what conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier, one of the officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Formal conclusions may take months to reach, but what's known raises the possibility that a lack of coordination between police and fire officials prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and other victims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TSA workers at LAX have been wondering the same thing, said Victor Payes, who works at the airport and is president of the local union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,\" Payes said. \"We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives for the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Los Angeles Airport Police said they couldn't comment on the ongoing investigation until extensive reports are finished.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say that Paul Ciancia entered Terminal 3 with a duffel bag, pulled out an assault rifle and started shooting. They said he had a note in his bag that said he wanted to \"kill TSA\" and that he wanted to stir fear in them, criticizing their searches as unconstitutional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was shot by airport police officers four times, in the mouth and leg, before being taken into custody. He remains in fair condition at a hospital and his doctors will determine when he's fit to appear in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the chaotic moments after the gunfire began, as travelers dove to the ground or scrambled for cover in restaurants and stores, officials worried there could be bombs in the terminal and tried to determine whether the gunman had any accomplices. In the first 30 minutes, there was also an unfounded report of two suspicious people on an adjacent parking garage roof, one of the officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers from multiple agencies bent down to check on Hernandez before moving on, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police broadcast over their radios that Ciancia was in custody at 9:25 a.m., five minutes after Hernandez was shot in the chest. That's when a nearly 26-year veteran Los Angeles police officer checked on Hernandez several times, repeatedly telling officers who came by from various agencies \"he's dead,\" according to one of the law enforcement officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's unclear whether the officer was qualified to determine Hernandez was dead. No officers rendered first aid on scene, according to surveillance video reviewed by the officials. Finally, airport police put Hernandez in a wheelchair and ran him to an ambulance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trauma surgeon David Plurad said Hernandez had no signs of life when he arrived at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nMasilamaniswara Temple, Thiruvaduthurai\nMasilamaniswara Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Hindu god Shiva, located in the village of Thiruvaduthurai, located 22 km from the South Indian town, Kumbakonam and 14 km from Mayiladuthurai, Tamil Nadu. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. The temple is referred to in the verses of Tevaram, the 7th century Tamil Saiva canon by Tirugnana Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar. The temple is associated with the legend of Saivite saint Tirumular (6th century CE).\nThe temple is believed to have been built by Cholas during 9th century A.D and with significant additions from later Chola kings and by the subsequent ruling empires. It houses five-tiered gateway towers known as gopurams. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Masilamaniswarar and Oppilamulai Nayagi Amman being the most prominent. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and three yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by the Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam, whose headquarters is located inside the temple.\n\nLegend\nLegend associates the temple with the saivite saint Tirumular (6th century CE). Tirumular saw a herd of cows lamenting the death of their herdsmen named Moolan. Being a siddha, he entered into the body of Moolan, came back alive to serve as the herdsman. It is believed that he was coming from North to South India to meet sage Agastya. When he went back to the place where he left his original body, he did not find it. Considering it as a divine play, he continued to remain in the body of Moolan for the rest of his life.As per another legend, Parvathi was cursed to become a cow and she worshipped Shiva to attain her original form. The legend is closely associated with this temple, but is also associated with other temples like Thenupuriswarar Temple at Patteswaram, Aavoor Pasupatheeswaram and Tirukogarnam near Pudukkottai.\n\nHistory\nThe temple is counted as one of the earliest temples built during the regime of Parantaka I. An inscription in the temple indicates record of grants to pipers, land endowments, flower gardens, carriers of sacred water during his third regnal year. Another inscription from his 38th regnal year recorded as 143 of 1925 indicates  gift of 500 kalanjus of gold for the construction of the kudapadai upwards. Historians believe that the temple was built by Tirukaralippichan and was completed during the regime of Parantaka. There are other inscriptions that indicate donation of gold and silver vessels to the temple. The inscriptions from Rajaraja I recorded as 104 and 107 of 1925 indicate similar gift of metal images to the temple. This is counted as the first mention of portrait installation indicated in an inscription, with the other ones being in Konerirajapuram and Thiruvisanallur temples. The temple has been maintained and administered by the Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam, whose headquarters is located inside the temple.\n\nArchitecture\nThe temple is located 12 km away from Mayiladuthurai and 24 km away from Kumbakonam. The temple has a five tiered Rajagopuram with elevated stone walls separating the second, third and fourth precinct. The images of the presiding deity, Masilamaniswarar, in the form of Shiva lingam occupies the main sanctum facing east. The shrine of the consort of Masilamaniswarar, Oppilamulaiyar faces west. The third prakaram has a separate shrine for the saivite saint Tirumular. The temple has three water bodies located at various places inside the temple. The Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam is located in the premises outside the fourth precinct.\n\nReligious significance\nThe temple is revered in the verses of Tevaram, the 7th century Saivite canonical work by the three saint poets, namely, Appar, Sambandar and Sundarar.  The temple is reverred by Sambandar in the third Tirumurai in one verse, Appar in five and Sundarar in two verses.\n\"இடரினும் தளரினும் எனதுறுநோய்\nதொடரினும் உனகழல் தொழுதெழுவேன்\nகடல்தனில் அமுதொடு கலந்தநஞ்சை\nமிடறினில் அடக்கிய வே", "acc_len": 2.533665835411471}

The compliance audit provides information that FSA can use to assess the school’s administration of federal student aid programs and to identify schools that require additional oversight because they do not fully comply with federal student aid administrative requirements. The OIG is required to assess the quality of school compliance audits and selects a sample to review each year. The OIG reviews the audit documentation to ensure that it supports the auditor’s opinions and that the audit results are reliable. According to agency guidance, FSA staff should refer compliance audits to the OIG for a quality review if they have any concerns about the quality of the audits. Both FSA and OIG officials stated that the OIG has primary responsibility for issues related to audit quality. When a school first applies to be certified to administer federal student aid, FSA will either approve the school for provisional certification— generally for 1 year—or deny certification (see fig. 1). Once a school is approved for initial certification and applies for recertification, FSA will provisionally or fully recertify the school, or deny certification. According to FSA procedures, FSA uses provisional certification for initial, or first time, applicants, as well as schools that are applying for recertification. Provisional certification is the only approval status available to new schools. In addition, FSA may decide to recertify a school provisionally if it determines that a school has not fully complied with federal student aid requirements. FSA prohibits provisionally certified schools from opening new campus locations or offering new programs without approval from FSA, and provisionally certified schools that are denied recertification have a less substantive appeals process than fully certified schools. Further, recertified schools in provisional status are subject to more FSA oversight than schools that are fully certified. FSA procedures allow for some discretion in determining for how long to certify a school. Provisional recertification generally lasts 1 to 3 years, while full recertification generally lasts 4 to 6 years. Education’s FSA regional staff draw information from a variety of sources during the certification process to assess a school’s capability to administer federal student aid. According to FSA documents, regional staff are to review information collected from schools and third parties, such as annual compliance audits conducted by independent auditors, among other information sources. FSA staff responsible for different functional areas, such as financial and compliance audits, accreditation status, and student loan default rates, compile and review information on schools, according to FSA procedures. FSA officials told us that these staff meet to discuss any potential program eligibility issues and to ensure that all information relevant to a school is considered before making a certification decision. FSA’s certification procedures outline some of the key information that regional staff should assess, some of which is relevant to both initial and recertification decisions, and some of which is specific to each type of certification process (see fig. 2). Documents and policies provided by schools: FSA regional staff are directed to review documents submitted by schools, including school catalogs, and certain school policies—such as admissions and student refund policies—that are relevant to assessing administrative capability. Proof of accreditation: School accreditors are responsible for applying and enforcing standards to help ensure that the education offered by schools is of sufficient quality to achieve program objectives. Accreditation of schools, which generally includes a site visit, takes place on a cycle that may range from every few years to as many as 10 years. Proof of state authorization: States are responsible for authorizing schools to offer postsecondary education and respond to student complaints. The process for approving schools varies from state to state and may include on-site visits. Audited financial statements: FSA regional staff are directed to review information in audited financial statements to assess schools’ financial health. Schools are required to have annual audited financial statements issued by an independent certified public accountant or a government auditor. Self-reported school data: FSA regional staff are instructed to review data on continual student enrollment in eligible academic programs", "acc_len": 2.546134663341646}

To his sombre\nand cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and\nnothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand\nover the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with\na mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation.  It\nwas indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not\nany lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to\nlay very few of my records before the public.  My participation in some\nof his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and\nreticence upon me.\n\nIt was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\nfrom Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a\ntelegram would serve--in the following terms:\n\nWhy not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled.\n\nI have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter\nfresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should\nrecount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may\narrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the\ncase and to lay the narrative before my readers.\n\nIt was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron\nconstitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant\nhard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional\nindiscretions of his own.  In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of\nHarley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day\nrecount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay\naside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished\nto avert an absolute breakdown.  The state of his health was not a\nmatter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental\ndetachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of\nbeing permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete\nchange of scene and air.  Thus it was that in the early spring of that\nyear we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at\nthe further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.\n\nIt was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim\nhumour of my patient.  From the windows of our little whitewashed\nhouse, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the\nwhole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing\nvessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which\ninnumerable seamen have met their end.  With a northerly breeze it lies\nplacid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it\nfor rest and protection.\n\nThen come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from\nthe south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle\nin the creaming breakers.  The wise mariner stands far out from that\nevil place.\n\nOn the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was\na country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional\nchurch tower to mark the site of some old-world village.  In every\ndirection upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race\nwhich had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange\nmonuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes\nof the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife.\nThe glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of\nforgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he\nspent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the\nmoor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the\nChaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in\ntin.  He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was\nsettling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to\nhis unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,\nplunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more\nengrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had\ndr", "acc_len": 2.556786703601108}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>INTRODUCTION\nThe idea of language identification is to classify a given audio signal into a particular class using a classification algorithm. Commonly language identification task was done using i-vector systems [1]. A very well known approach for language identification proposed by N. Dahek et al. [1] uses the GMM-UBM model to obtain utterance level features called i-vectors. Recent advances in deep learning [15,16] have helped to improve the language identification task using many different neural network architectures which can be trained efficiently using GPUs for large scale datasets. These neural networks can be configured in various ways to obtain better accuracy for language identification task. Early work on using Deep learning for language Identification was published by Pavel Matejka et al. [2], where they used stacked bottleneck features extracted from deep neural networks for language identification task and showed that the bottleneck features learned by Deep neural networks are better than simple MFCC or PLP features. Later the work by I. Lopez-Moreno et al. [3] from Google showed how to use Deep neural networks to directly map the sequence of MFCC frames into its language class so that we can apply language identification at the frame level. Speech signals will have both spatial and temporal information, but simple DNNs are not able to capture temporal information. Work done by J. Gonzalez-Dominguez et al. [4] by Google developed an LSTM based language identification model which improves the accuracy over the DNN based models. Work done by Alicia et al. [5] used CNNs to improve upon i-vector [1] and other previously developed systems. The work done by Daniel Garcia-Romero et al. [6] has used a combination of Acoustic model trained for speech recognition with Time-delay neural networks where they train the TDNN model by feeding the stacked bottleneck features from acoustic model to predict the language labels at the frame level. Recently X-vectors [7] is proposed for speaker identification task and are shown to outperform all the previous state of the art speaker identification algorithms and are also used for language identification by David Snyder et al. [8].\nIn this paper, we explore multiple pooling strategies for language identification task. Mainly we propose Ghost-VLAD based pooling method for language identification. Inspired by the recent work by W. Xie et al. [9] and Y. Zhong et al. [10], we use Ghost-VLAD to improve the accuracy of language identification task for Indian languages. We explore multiple pooling strategies including NetVLAD pooling [11], Average pooling and Statistics pooling( as proposed in X-vectors [7]) and show that Ghost-VLAD pooling is the best pooling strategy for language identification. Our model obtains the best accuracy of 98.24%, and it outperforms all the other previously proposed pooling methods. We conduct all our experiments on 635hrs of audio data for 7 Indian languages collected from $\\textbf {All India Radio}$ news channel. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we explain the proposed pooling method for language identification. In section 3, we explain our dataset. In section 4, we describe the experiments, and in section 5, we describe the results.\nPOOLING STRATEGIES\nIn any language identification model, we want to obtain utterance level representation which has very good language discriminative features. These representations should be compact and should be easily separable by a linear classifier. The idea of any pooling strategy is to pool the frame-level representations into a single utterance level representation. Previous works by [7] have used simple mean and standard deviation aggregation to pool the frame-level features from the top layer of the neural network to obtain the utterance level features. Recently [9] used VLAD based pooling strategy for speaker identification which is inspired from [10] proposed for face recognition. The NetVLAD [11] and Ghost-VLAD [10] methods are proposed for Place recognition and face recognition, respectively, and in both cases, they try to aggregate the local descriptors into global features. In our case, the local descriptors are features extracted from ResNet [15], and the global utterance level feature is obtained by using GhostVLAD pooling. In this section, we explain different pooling methods, including NetVLAD, Ghost-VLAD, Statistic pooling, and Average pooling.\nPOOLING STRATEGIES ::: NetVLAD pooling\nThe NetVLAD pooling strategy was initially developed for place recognition by R. Arandjelovic et al. [11]. The NetVLAD is an extension to VLAD [18] approach where they were able to replace the hard assignment based clustering with soft assignment based clustering so that it can be trained with neural network in an end to end fashion. In our case, we use the NetVLAD layer to map N local features of dimension D into a fixed dimensional vector, as shown in Figure 1 (Left side).\nThe model takes spectrogram as an input and feeds into CNN based ResNet architecture.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>For other uses, see Electricity (disambiguation).\n\"Electric\" redirects here. For other uses, see Electric (disambiguation).\nLightning is one of the most dramatic effects of electricity.\nElectricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. In early days, electricity was considered as being not related to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.\nThe presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.\nWhen a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.\nelectronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.\nLong before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra‘ad (رعد) applied to the electric ray.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nBenjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\", from ἤλεκτρον, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Since 1993, USAID has obligated more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, primarily using funds appropriated through the ESF. According to State officials, through the ESF, USAID provides project assistance and debt relief payments to PA creditors. USAID, with overall foreign policy guidance from State, implements most ESF programs, including programs related to private sector development, health, water and road infrastructure, local governance, civil society, rule of law, education, and youth development. According to USAID officials, this assistance to the West Bank and Gaza contributes to building a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society—a goal that USAID described as being in the interest of the Palestinians, the United States, and Israel. Figure 1 shows the location of the West Bank and Gaza relative to surrounding countries. USAID assistance to the West Bank and Gaza is conducted under antiterrorism policies and procedures outlined in an administrative policy document known as Mission Order 21. The stated purpose of the mission order, as amended, is to describe policies and procedures to ensure that the mission’s program assistance does not inadvertently provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism. We have previously reported on the status of ESF assistance to the Palestinians and USAID’s antiterrorism policies and procedures in the West Bank and Gaza. As of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $544.1 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $350.6 million (over 64 percent) of approximately $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (see table 1). USAID obligated portions of the allocated funds for direct payments to PA creditors—specifically, payments to two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and to a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. Project assistance obligated for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 accounted for about $215 million (74 percent) and $184 million (72 percent), respectively, of USAID’s obligations of ESF assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for those fiscal years (see fig. 1). Payments to the PA’s creditors accounted for the remaining obligations—about $75 million (26 percent) of fiscal year 2015 obligations and about $70 million (28 percent) of fiscal year 2016 obligations. According to USAID documents, ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 was obligated for three USAID development objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure (about $239 million), Investing in the Next Generation (about $107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). Program support—which sustains all development objectives, according to USAID—accounted for about $29 million (see table 2). Economic Growth and Infrastructure. The largest share—about 60 percent—of USAID’s ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported the agency’s Economic Growth and Infrastructure development objective. According to USAID documents, as of March 31, 2018, the agency had obligated about $239 million and expended approximately $89 million (about 37 percent) for projects under this objective. USAID officials stated that the agency funded these projects under the following standard State-budgeted program areas: health (including water), infrastructure, private sector competiveness, and stabilization operations and security sector reform. The largest project—the Architecture and Engineering Services project—received about $20 million of fiscal year 2015 ESF assistance and $17 million of fiscal year 2016 ESF assistance. The purpose of the project was to rehabilitate and construct infrastructure through the procurement of infrastructure services, including engineering design and construction management, among other things. The contractor was required to coordinate with relevant PA and Israeli entities, as well as with USAID, to assist in the selection of PA water and wastewater projects and in the planning and design of water projects such as small- to large-scale water distribution systems, water treatment systems, and institutional capacity building. Investing in the Next Generation. The second-largest share—about 27 percent—of USAID’s fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza supported the agency’s Investing in the Next Generation development objective. According to USAID documents, as of March 31, 2018, the agency had obligated about $107 million and expended approximately $79 million (about 74 percent) for projects under this objective.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Congressional interest in small business access to capital has increased in recent years because of concerns that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Small businesses have played an important role in net job growth during previous economic recoveries, particularly in the construction, housing, and retail sectors. For example, after the eight-month recession that began in July 1990 and ended in March 1991, small businesses (defined for this purpose as having fewer than 500 employees) increased their net employment in the first year after the recession, whereas larger businesses continued to experience declines in employment. During the most recent recession (December 2007-June 2009), small businesses accounted for almost 60% of net job losses. From the end of the recession through the end of FY2012, small businesses accounted for about 63% of net new jobs, close to their historical average share of net new job creation. Since then, small businesses have added about 65% of net new jobs. Some have argued that the federal government should provide additional resources to assist small businesses. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. Several laws were enacted during the 111 th Congress to enhance small business access to capital. For example, P.L. 111-5 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the Small Business Administration (SBA) an additional $730 million, including $375 million to temporarily subsidize SBA fees and increase the 7(a) loan guaranty program's maximum loan guaranty percentage from 85% on loans of $150,000 or less and 75% on loans exceeding $150,000 to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans. P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) ($4.0 billion was issued) to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses. It also authorized a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs, numerous changes to the SBA's loan guaranty and contracting programs, funding to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. P.L. 111-322 , the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue its fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted, which occurred on January 3, 2011. According to the SBA, the temporary fee subsidies and 90% maximum loan guaranty for the 7(a) program \"engineered a significant turnaround in SBA lending.... The end result is that the agency helped put more than $42 billion in the hands of small businesses through the Recovery Act and Jobs Act combined.\" This report focuses on the SBLF. It begins with a discussion of the supply and demand for small business loans. The SBLF's advocates argued that the fund was an important part of a larger effort to enhance the supply of small business loans. After describing the program's structure, the report then examines other arguments that were presented both for and against the program's enactment. Advocates claimed the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the SBLF's implementation by the Department of the Treasury and a discussion of bills introduced during recent Congresses to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112 th Congress, S. 681 , the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have, among other provisions, limited the program's authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program. H.R. 2807 , the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF when its investment authority expired on September 27, 2011, to", "acc_len": 2.592797783933518}

And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going backwards now , so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this {disfmarker} uh , make these sounds , and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad E: And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some {disfmarker} some sentences . No , right ?\nGrad D: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah , for a couple {disfmarker}\nGrad D: So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a {disfmarker} er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like {disfmarker} the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a {disfmarker} basically , a goal and it , you know , says \" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,\nGrad B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad D: so it just starts {disfmarker} uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means \" build the tree . \"\nGrad B: OK .\nGrad D: And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .\nGrad E: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the {disfmarker} the syntax trees for three or four .\nGrad D: We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple .

The games that were scheduled for the third week of the season were cancelled, reducing the 16-game season to 15, but the games for Weeks 4, 5 and 6 were played with replacement players. The NFLPA actually ended the strike before the Week 6 slate of games, but the NFL owners' unanimously nixed their return that week because the union had missed an owner-mandated deadline that week to be eligible to return, and would have to wait until Week 7 to resume playing. Approximately 15% of the NFLPA’s players chose to cross picket lines to play during the strike; prominent players who did so included New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, 49ers running back Roger Craig, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent. The replacement players were mostly those left out of work by the recent folding of the Canadian Football League’s Montreal Alouettes and the 1986 dissolution of the United States Football League, as well as others who had been preseason cuts, had long left professional football or were other assorted oddities (such as cinematographer Todd Schlopy, who, despite never playing professional football before or after the strike, served as placekicker for his hometown Buffalo Bills for three games). The replacement players, called to play on short notice and having little chance to gel as teammates, were widely treated with scorn by the press and general public, including name-calling, public shaming and accusations of being scabs. The games played by these replacement players were regarded with even less legitimacy – attendance plummeted to under 10,000 fans at many of the games in smaller markets and cities with strong union presence, including a low of 4,074 for the lone replacement game played in Philadelphia) — but nonetheless were counted as regular NFL games. Final television revenues were down by about 20%, a smaller drop than the networks had expected. The defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants went 0–3 in replacement games, ultimately costing them a chance to make the playoffs and to repeat their championship. The final replacement game was a Monday Night Football matchup on October 19, 1987, with the Washington Redskins at the Dallas Cowboys. Along with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Redskins were the only other NFL team not to have any players cross the picket line and were surprising 13–7 victors over the Cowboys who had plenty of big name players cross the picket line.\n\nParagraph 2: Final opinions on the album were mixed. Hope called it \"an easy listen with the same soothing vocals and clean cut sing-a-long choruses we've grown to love. Overall a great offering but not overly addictive.\" Beringer praised the band's growth in musicianship in the years since From Here to Infirmary, but also commented that This Addiction \"could be polarizing to fans, splitting them into three groups: fans who love the album because it goes back to the band's roots, fans who dislike this album because they may think it's a cheap imitation of older days, and the fans who might think this is a step backwards from the previous album.\" Heisel concluded that \"while This Addiction might not be perfect, it's a more than respectable entry into the band's already sizeable canon, proving that though they may be in that rarified group of punk-rock lifers, Alkaline Trio aren't done evolving yet.\" Apar stated that although the album was purported to be a return to the early sound of Goddamnit, he found it more comparable to From Here to Infirmary \"since the end result is still the same polished album full of vaguely gothic and bloody references where characters like Draculina live -- no real bitterness, sore-throat defiance, or endearing heartache to be found.\" Though complimenting \"This Addiction\" and \"Off the Map\" as strong songs, he felt that the album failed to live up to its expectations as a return to roots: \"Alkaline Trio just can't seem to recapture the spirit of their early days, when purpose and emotion fueled every note. Instead, one is left with totally competent -- and at times, yes, catchy -- songs that ring just a bit too hollow compared to the urgent leave-it-all-on-the-floor guts of those earliest releases [...] despite the polished and punchy singalong choruses, This Addiction is really just more of the same recycled melodies from the Trio rather than any sort of rebirth.\" Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound agreed that the album did not succeed in recapturing the band's early sound, but was a strong effort nonetheless: \"Alkaline Trio aren't naïve punk rockers from the Chicago suburbs anymore, as a result this album fails to recapture that innocence but succeeds in creating another strong body of work that", "acc_len": 2.598337950138504}

Based on a 1937 novel of the same name by Charles L. Clifford and directed by Henry Hathaway, the film is set against the backdrop of the Moro Rebellion during the American occupation of the Philippines at the beginning of the 20th century. According to The World news broadcast on Aug 18, 2017, the US War Department withdrew the film in 1942. The Moros were US allies in World War II, and the film had inflammatory scenes including threatening a Muslim prisoner with burial wrapped in a pig skin.\n\nPlot\nIn 1906, Alipang (Tetsu Komai) and his Muslim Moro guerrillas are terrorizing the people of the Philippine island of Mindanao, raiding villages, killing the men, and carrying off the women and children for slaves. Instead of maintaining garrisons indefinitely to protect the Filipinos, the U.S. army tests out a new tactic at Fort Mysang. The army detachment is replaced by a handful of officers – Colonel Hatch (Roy Gordon), Captains Manning (Russell Hicks) and Hartley (Reginald Owen), and Lieutenants McCool (David Niven) and Larsen (Broderick Crawford) – who are to train the native Philippine Constabulary to take over the burden. Army doctor Lieutenant Canavan (Gary Cooper) is sent along to keep them healthy. They are welcomed by a skeptical Padre Rafael (Charles Waldron).\nAlipang starts sending fanatical juramentados to assassinate the officers and goad them into attacking before the natives are fully trained. Hatch is the first victim, leaving Manning to take command. Manning's wife (Kay Johnson) and Hartley's daughter Linda (Andrea Leeds) arrive for a visit at the worst possible time; a horrified Mrs. Manning witnesses her husband's murder. Hartley takes charge, but Canavan disagrees with his by-the-book, overcautious approach. Disobeying orders, Canavan sets out for Alipang's camp guided by Miguel (Benny Inocencio), a young Moro boy he has befriended. \"Mike\" (as Canavan calls him) infiltrates the camp and learns that Alipang has sent another assassin, this time for Hartley. Canavan and Mike intercept the man and take him back a prisoner.\nLinda and Canavan fall in love, much to the disappointment of McCool and Larsen. When Hartley insists she leave Mysang with Mrs. Manning, she refuses and helps out at the hospital.\nAlipang then dams the river on which the villagers depend. Hartley refuses to send a detachment into the jungle to blow it up (he is concealing the fact that he is slowly going blind from an old head wound). The people have to rely on an old well, but the contaminated water causes a cholera epidemic. Finally, Hartley has no choice but to send Larsen and some men to destroy the dam. They do not return.\nThe Datu (Vladimir Sokoloff), a supposedly friendly Moro leader, offers to guide Hartley and his men to the dam, but he is actually leading them into an ambush. Canavan learns of the Datu's treachery from Mike, the sole survivor of Larsen's detachment, and races to warn Hartley. Canavan forces the Datu to take him to the dam. The Datu is killed in a booby trap, but Canavan manages to dynamite the dam anyway. Then, he and the men raft back to the village, which is under attack by Alipang's men.\nMcCool is killed leading the defense, but Canavan and the rest return in time to turn the tide. Alipang is killed by Filipino Lieutenant Yabo (Rudy Robles). Their mission accomplished, the Hartleys and Canavan depart, leaving the village in Yabo's care.\n\nCast\nGary Cooper as Dr. Bill Canavan\nDavid Niven as Lieutenant Terence McCool\nAndrea Leeds as Linda Hartley\nReginald Owen as Captain Steve Hartley\nBroderick Crawford as Lieutenant Larsen.

The author of works like The Raven and the The Black Cat was found in a confused state on the streets of Baltimore in October 1849 and died in a city hospital a few days later at the age of 40.\nA life-size replica of Poe's body went on display in a pine casket at the Poe House in Baltimore on October 7 for visitors to pay their respects, according to Jeff Jerome, curator of the Poe Museum.\n\"This actually is the bicentennial of Poe's birth and there was very little we could do with the birth so we thought we would recreate Poe's funeral since his original funeral was very quick. There were only seven people in attendance,\" Jerome told Reuters Television.\n\"I thought this would be Baltimore's chance to make it right, to do it the right way.\"\nThe casket was loaded onto an old fashioned hearse and taken through the city to Westminster Burying Ground where the writer is buried.\nMany Poe fans gathered to bid a proper farewell to the writer whose life had been a struggle as he made very little money from his writing.\nMany dressed in period costumes to join the funeral procession, some dressed as famous people who had either known Poe or had been inspired by him, such as Walt Whitman, Charles Baudelaire, and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\"Personally Edgar Allan Poe has meant so much to me as far as his creativity and originality so it is great to be here.

Cruickshanks is the father of Jamie Dundee and was the father-in-law of wrestler Bobby Eaton.\n\nCareer\nDundee was born in Angus, Scotland, and raised in Melbourne. At 16, he joined the circus as a trapeze artist. He started wrestling in Australia in 1962 and finally arrived in the United States as \"Superstar\" Bill Dundee in 1974 with his tag team partner George Barnes.\nDundee made a name for himself in the Memphis Territory, where he regularly teamed and feuded with Jerry Lawler and Jimmy Valiant for years. Dundee and Lawler ventured to the American Wrestling Association in 1987 and captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship twice.\nAs a singles wrestler, he held the Southern Heavyweight Championship belt several times from 1975 to 1985. Also, he had a successful team with \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Landel that wreaked havoc in Tennessee.\nDundee had a brief run in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions, Central States Wrestling and Florida Championship Wrestling in 1986, where he teamed with Jimmy Garvin and feuded with Sam Houston for the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship. He also briefly managed The Barbarian and The MOD Squad while in those territories.\nHe also had a run in World Championship Wrestling in the early 1990s as Sir William, the manager for Lord Steven Regal.\nDundee worked as a booker for Memphis, Louisiana and Georgia.\nDundee is still active as of 2019 in Memphis Wrestling, where he has been a heel and a baby face. He frequently appears on Jackson, Tennessee, talk radio station WNWS 101.5 with Dan Reeves and on a talk show on Public-access television cable TV channels in West Tennessee. He still promotes indy cards across Tennessee and in Southaven, Mississippi. He currently runs a podcast on Anchor named If You Don't Want the Answer, Don't Ask the Question.\nOn 20 July 2019, Dundee, at 75 years old, defeated Tony Deppen to win the unofficial WOMBAT Television Championship for Game Changer Wrestling in Tullahoma, Tennessee.\n\nBooks\nIf You Don't Want The Answer, Don't Ask The Question: Bill Dundee's Life Story\n\nPersonal life\nDundee's son Jamie Dundee, also became a wrestler, whereas his daughter Donna, married wrestler Bobby Eaton. His grandson, Dylan Eaton, wrestles as well.\nIn the early 1990s he partnered with Doug Hurt, brother of Jerry Lawler's manager, in the opening of a furniture store in Evansville, Indiana called \"Superstar Dundee Furniture\". The store collapsed about a year after opening.\nOn 26 June 2021, his daughter Donna died at the age of 57 from breast cancer. Just over a month later, his son-in-law Bobby Eaton died on 4 August 2021 at the age of 62, just two weeks after suffering a fall at his home.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nAmerican Wrestling Federation\nAWF Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCentral States Wrestling\nNWA Central States Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nMemphis Wrestling Hall of Fame\nClass of 2017\nMid-South Wrestling Association\nMid-South Television Championship (1 time)\nNWA Mid-America / Continental Wrestling Association / Championship Wrestling Association\nAWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (9 times)\nAWA Southern Tag Team Championship (14 times) – with Norvell Austin (1), Robert Gibson (1), Jerry Lawler (4), Robert Fuller (1), Tommy Rich (2), Dream Machine (2), Steve Keirn (2) and Dutch Mantel (1)\nAWA World Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Jerry Lawler1\nCWA International Heavyweight Championship (4 times)\nCWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Rocky Johnson\nCWA Southwestern Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCWA World Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nCWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Tommy Rich\nNWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nNWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Ricky Gibson\nNWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Memphis version) (1 time)\nNWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version) (3 times) – with Big Bad John (2) and Tommy Rich (1)\nNWA United States Junior Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\nOhio Valley Wrestling\nOVW Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nPower Pro Wrestling\nPPW Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Jerry Lawler\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nRanked No. 56 of the 100 top tag", "acc_len": 2.6149584487534625}

In particular, we focus on more than 1.5M tweets collected on the day of the election of Donald Trump as 45th president of the United States of America. We use the meta-data embedded within those tweets in order to look for differences between tweets containing fake news and tweets not containing them. Specifically, we perform our analysis only on tweets that went viral, by studying proxies for users' exposure to the tweets, by characterizing accounts spreading fake news, and by looking at their polarization. We found significant differences on the distribution of followers, the number of URLs on tweets, and the verification of the users.\n]\nIntroduction\nWhile fake news, understood as deliberately misleading pieces of information, have existed since long ago (e.g. it is not unusual to receive news falsely claiming the death of a celebrity), the term reached the mainstream, particularly so in politics, during the 2016 presidential election in the United States BIBREF0 . Since then, governments and corporations alike (e.g. Google BIBREF1 and Facebook BIBREF2 ) have begun efforts to tackle fake news as they can affect political decisions BIBREF3 . Yet, the ability to define, identify and stop fake news from spreading is limited.\nSince the Obama campaign in 2008, social media has been pervasive in the political arena in the United States. Studies report that up to 62% of American adults receive their news from social media BIBREF4 . The wide use of platforms such as Twitter and Facebook has facilitated the diffusion of fake news by simplifying the process of receiving content with no significant third party filtering, fact-checking or editorial judgement. Such characteristics make these platforms suitable means for sharing news that, disguised as legit ones, try to confuse readers.\nSuch use and their prominent rise has been confirmed by Craig Silverman, a Canadian journalist who is a prominent figure on fake news BIBREF5 : “In the final three months of the US presidential campaign, the top-performing fake election news stories on Facebook generated more engagement than the top stories from major news outlet”.\nOur current research hence departs from the assumption that social media is a conduit for fake news and asks the question of whether fake news (as spam was some years ago) can be identified, modelled and eventually blocked. In order to do so, we use a sample of more that 1.5M tweets collected on November 8th 2016 —election day in the United States— with the goal of identifying features that tweets containing fake news are likely to have. As such, our paper aims to provide a preliminary characterization of fake news in Twitter by looking into meta-data embedded in tweets. Considering meta-data as a relevant factor of analysis is in line with findings reported by Morris et al. BIBREF6 . We argue that understanding differences between tweets containing fake news and regular tweets will allow researchers to design mechanisms to block fake news in Twitter.\nSpecifically, our goals are: 1) compare the characteristics of tweets labelled as containing fake news to tweets labelled as not containing them, 2) characterize, through their meta-data, viral tweets containing fake news and the accounts from which they originated, and 3) determine the extent to which tweets containing fake news expressed polarized political views.\nFor our study, we used the number of retweets to single-out those that went viral within our sample. Tweets within that subset (viral tweets hereafter) are varied and relate to different topics. We consider that a tweet contains fake news if its text falls within any of the following categories described by Rubin et al. BIBREF7 (see next section for the details of such categories): serious fabrication, large-scale hoaxes, jokes taken at face value, slanted reporting of real facts and stories where the truth is contentious. The dataset BIBREF8 , manually labelled by an expert, has been publicly released and is available to researchers and interested parties.\nFrom our results, the following main observations can be made:\nOur findings resonate with similar work done on fake news such as the one from Allcot and Gentzkow BIBREF9 . Therefore, even if our study is a preliminary attempt at characterizing fake news on Twitter using only their meta-data, our results provide external validity to previous research. Moreover, our work not only stresses the importance of using meta-data, but also underscores which parameters may be useful to identify fake news on Twitter.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly discusses where this work is located within the literature on fake news and contextualizes the type of fake news we are studying. Then, we present our hypotheses, the data,", "acc_len": 2.6204986149584486}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walküre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walküre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walküre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. – requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walküre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the Ride of the Valkyries\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\nHow To Measure Horse Height - Cowboy Way\nMeasure Horse Height\nNote: Links with green  underlines are shopping links and will open in a new window\nHow To Measure Horse Height\nIt's easy to measure you horse's height accurately.\nTo determine how tall a horse is measure the horse, in inches, from  the ground in a straight line up to the highest point of the withers.

The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history.\n\nIn early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu.\n\nHistory\n\nKotayk\nUrartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.\n\nYerevan\n\nFC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007.\nExperience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth.

It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand).\n\nTraining centre/academy\nBanants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin.\n\nFans\nThe most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district.

(Lloydminster, another mandatory market, had no local Radio-Canada transmitter.) On August 16, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted the CBC permission to continue operating 22 repeaters in mandatory markets, including CBRFT and CBXFT-3, in analog until August 31, 2012, by which time the transmitters had to convert to digital or shut down.

The review also found that \"there's no denying that his harsh communiqués crackle with a mean-streets vitality as fascinating as his confrontational world view is disturbing.\" Robert Christgau gave the Jive reissue of the album a B, stating \"What other rapper would write a rhyme about the night his mother pulled a gun on him—or make it so clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove.\" Spin stated that it \"can't sustain an album with just reverb and a cowbell. Even if it is killer reverb and a way funky cowbell.\" The NME placed Saturday Night! – The Album at number 20 on their list of the top albums of 1987. The single \"Saturday Night\" was also listed at number 28 on their list of Top 50 tracks of the year. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the album a three star rating, stating that \"while everything doesn't match [the title track \"Saturday Night\"]\" there's plenty here to establish him as a solid rap citizen.\" declaring that the artist \"may take the most consistently unsparing look at the streets since \"The Message\".\n\nParagraph 3: Harry Haywood's 1948 book, Negro Liberation,  was the first major study of the African-American national question written by an African-American Marxist. He argued that the root of the oppression of Blacks was the unsolved agrarian question in the South. He believed that the unfinished bourgeois democratic revolution of Reconstruction had been betrayed in the Hayes-Tilden Compromise of 1877. It abandoned African Americans to plantations as tenant farmers and sharecroppers, faced with the Redeemer governments, the system of Jim Crow laws, and the terror of the Ku Klux Klan and other paramilitary groups. According to Haywood, the rise of imperialism left blacks frozen as \"landless, semi-slaves in the South.\" According to Haywood's autobiography, Paul Robeson subsidized his work on the project by offering $100 a month. It was translated and published in Russian, Polish, German, Czech and Hungarian. It was reprinted in 1976 by Liberator Press, the publishing arm of the October League. Haywood argued that \"the position of the book was not new, but a reaffirmation of the revolutionary position developed at the Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928. The heart of this position is that the problem is fundamentally a question of an oppressed nation with full rights of self-determination. It emphasized the revolutionary essence of the struggle for Black equality arising from the fact that the special oppression of Blacks is a main prop of the system of imperialist domination over the entire working class and the masses of exploited American people. Therefore the struggle for Black liberation is a component part of the struggle for proletarian revolution. It is the historic task of the working-class movement, as it advances on the road to socialism, to solve the problem of land and freedom of the Black masses.\" On the other hand, Haywood went on to write, \"What was new in the book was the thorough analysis of the concrete conditions of Black people in the post-war period. I made extensive use of population data; the 1940 census, the 1947 Plantation Count and other sources, in order to show that the present day conditions affirmed the essential correctness of the position we had formulated years before.\" Because of this and other works, Robert F. Williams called Harry Haywood \"one of the modern pioneers in the Black liberation struggle.\"\n\n", "acc_len": 2.6454293628808863}

The group are offered a contract by Atlantic Pictures who are relocating to the Pacific and they all head to Hollywood.\nLeo moves from New Jersey to California to keep one step ahead of the Motion Picture Patents Company, which is out to destroy any non-authorized equipment violating the Edison Trust. Leo finally settles in with other filmmakers in Hollywoodland, California, and makes a series of dramatic, romantic, and comedic shorts as throwaways.\nWhile initially believing movies are just a brief flickering kind of entertainment, Leo and the crew are profoundly affected when they go to see the 1915 world premiere of D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation, which transforms the motion picture industry. The film gets a standing ovation and Leo is left feeling inadequate. After the film, they re-encounter Cobb who speaks to camera enthusing about what the cinema can bring.

He took the idea to W.D. Richter, with whom he had worked a number of times, and Richter agreed to write the project on \"spec\" for the producers (Winkler's producing partner was Bob Chartoff). Richter's final script was called Starlight Parade, and attracted interest from United Artists and Columbia. David Begelman at Columbia suggested Peter Bogdanovich as director.Winkler later stated:\n\nHe made David come to his office and wait until the receptionist said: 'Mr. Bogdanovich will see you now.' As soon as we came inside, we were very haughtily told that he thought the script was a piece of [garbage]. I'd been around long enough to know that I should take that as a bad sign. I remember coming out of the meeting, saying, 'David, why should we make the movie with someone who hates our script?' And all David said was, 'Hey, he's a genius.' ... What he filmed had nothing to do with the original script. I know it meant a lot to Peter to have all of the authentic stories about the silent period in the film, but Rick's script, authentic or not, was terrific. It was just a great drama. By the time Peter was done with it, it was authentic, but it wasn't dramatic anymore. Peter hadn't really experienced any failure yet —  we hired him before At Long Last Love had come out - so he was easily the most arrogant person", "acc_len": 2.6509695290858724}

She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano \"had nothing to do with Will's resurrection\", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release – and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave – and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive – but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.\n\nParagraph 2: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nLanguage model pretraining has advanced the state of the art in many NLP tasks ranging from sentiment analysis, to question answering, natural language inference, named entity recognition, and textual similarity. State-of-the-art pretrained models include ELMo BIBREF1, GPT BIBREF2, and more recently Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Bert; BIBREF0). Bert combines both word and sentence representations in a single very large Transformer BIBREF3; it is pretrained on vast amounts of text, with an unsupervised objective of masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction and can be fine-tuned with various task-specific objectives.\nIn most cases, pretrained language models have been employed as encoders for sentence- and paragraph-level natural language understanding problems BIBREF0 involving various classification tasks (e.g., predicting whether any two sentences are in an entailment relationship; or determining the completion of a sentence among four alternative sentences). In this paper, we examine the influence of language model pretraining on text summarization. Different from previous tasks, summarization requires wide-coverage natural language understanding going beyond the meaning of individual words and sentences. The aim is to condense a document into a shorter version while preserving most of its meaning. Furthermore, under abstractive modeling formulations, the task requires language generation capabilities in order to create summaries containing novel words and phrases not featured in the source text, while extractive summarization is often defined as a binary classification task with labels indicating whether a text span (typically a sentence) should be included in the summary.\nWe explore the potential of Bert for text summarization under a general framework encompassing both extractive and abstractive modeling paradigms. We propose a novel document-level encoder based on Bert which is able to encode a document and obtain representations for its sentences. Our extractive model is built on top of this encoder by stacking several inter-sentence Transformer layers to capture document-level features for extracting sentences. Our abstractive model adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, combining the same pretrained Bert encoder with a randomly-initialized Transformer decoder BIBREF3. We design a new training schedule which separates the optimizers of the encoder and the decoder in order to accommodate the fact that the former is pretrained while the latter must be trained from scratch. Finally, motivated by previous work showing that the combination of extractive and abstractive objectives can help generate better summaries BIBREF4, we present a two-stage approach where the encoder is fine-tuned twice, first with an extractive objective and subsequently on the abstractive summarization task.\nWe evaluate the proposed approach on three single-document news summarization datasets representative of different writing conventions (e.g., important information is concentrated at the beginning of the document or distributed more evenly throughout) and summary styles (e.g., verbose vs. more telegraphic; extractive vs. abstractive). Across datasets, we experimentally show that the proposed models achieve state-of-the-art results under both extractive and abstractive settings. Our contributions in this work are three-fold: a) we highlight the importance of document encoding for the summarization task; a variety of recently proposed techniques aim to enhance summarization performance via copying mechanisms BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, reinforcement learning BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, and multiple communicating encoders BIBREF11. We achieve better results with a minimum-requirement model without using any of these mechanisms; b) we showcase ways to effectively employ pretrained language models in summarization under both extractive and abstractive settings; we would expect any improvements in model pretraining to translate in better summarization in the future; and c) the proposed models can be used as a stepping stone to further improve summarization performance as well as baselines against which new proposals are tested.\nBackground ::: Pretrained Language Models\nPretrained language models BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF0, BIBREF12, BIBREF13 have recently emerged as a key technology for achieving impressive gains in a wide variety of natural language tasks. These models extend the idea of word embeddings by learning contextual representations from large-scale corpora using a language modeling objective. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Bert; BIBREF0) is a new language representation model which is trained with a masked language modeling and a “next sentence prediction” task on a corpus of 3,300M words.\nThe general architecture of Bert is shown in the left part of Figure FIGREF2. Input text is first preprocessed by inserting two special tokens. [cls] is appended to the beginning of the text; the output representation of this token is used to aggregate information from the whole sequence (e.g., for classification tasks). And token [sep] is inserted after each sentence as an indicator of sentence boundaries. The modified text is then represented as a sequence of tokens $X=[w_1,w_2,\\cdots ,w_n]$. Each token $w_i$ is assigned three kinds of", "acc_len": 2.667590027700831}

His break in music came in 1969 when he recorded a version of John Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\" with a band called \"Hot Chocolate Band\". Unable to change the lyrics without Lennon's permission, he sent a copy to his record label, Apple, and the song was released with Lennon's approval. \n\nThe Hot Chocolate albums were produced by Mickie Most and recorded at the Rak Records studio. Brown left the group in 1985 to take a hiatus from music.   He soon went on to have a solo career, achieving success in the clubs with the 1987 single \"Body Rocking\", produced by Richard James Burgess. \n\nBrown was a supporter of the Conservative Party and performed at a party conference in the 1980s. In 1981, he performed at the wedding reception following the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, at Buckingham Palace. \n\nBrown owned National Hunt horses, including Gainsay. \n\nRecognition\n\nIn 2003, Queen Elizabeth II named Brown a Member of the Order of the British Empire for \"services to popular music for the United Kingdom\".

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nWaldrada of Lotharingia\nWaldrada was the mistress, and later the wife, of Lothair II of Lotharingia.\n\nBiography\nWaldrada's family origin is uncertain. The prolific 19th-century French writer Baron Ernouf suggested that Waldrada was of noble Gallo-Roman descent, sister of Thietgaud, the bishop of Trier, and niece of Gunther, archbishop of Cologne. However, these suggestions are not supported by any evidence, and more recent studies have instead suggested she was of relatively undistinguished social origins, though still from an aristocratic milieu.\nThe Vita Sancti Deicoli states that Waldrada was related to Eberhard II, Count of Nordgau (included Strasbourg) and the family of Etichonids, though this is a late 10th-century source and so may not be entirely reliable on this question.In 855 the Carolingian king Lothar II married Teutberga, a Carolingian aristocrat and the daughter of Bosonid Boso the Elder. The marriage was arranged by Lothar's father Lothar I for political reasons. It is very probable that Waldrada was already Lothar II's mistress at this time.Teutberga was allegedly not capable of bearing children and Lothar's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour. Lothair, whose desire for annulment was arguably prompted by his affection for Waldrada, put away Teutberga. However, Hucbert took up arms on his sister's behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, Emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the annulment and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862. However, Pope Nicholas I was suspicious of this and sent legates to investigate at the Council of Metz in 863. The Council found in favour of Lothair's divorce, which led to rumours that the papal legates may have bribed and thus meant that Nicholas order Lothair to take Teutberga back or face excommunication. \nWith the support of Charles the Bald and Louis the German, Teutberga appealed the annulment to Pope Nicholas. Nicholas refused to recognize the annulment and excommunicated Waldrada in 866, forcing Lothair to abandon Waldrada in favour of Teutberga. Lothair accepted this begrudgingly for a time, but shortly afterward at the end of 867 Pope Nicholas I died. Thus, Lothair began to seek the permission of the newly appointed Pope Adrian II to again put Teutberga aside and marry Waldrada, riding to Rome to speak with him on the matter in 869. However, on his way home, Lothair died.\n\nChildren\nWaldrada and Lothair II had some sons and probably three daughters, all of whom were declared illegitimate:\n\nHugh (c. 855–895), Duke of Alsace (867–885)\nGisela (c. 865–908), who in 883 married Godfrey, the Viking leader ruling in Frisia, who was murdered in 885\nBertha (c. 863–925), who married Theobald of Arles (c. 854–895), count of Arles, nephew of Teutberga. They had two sons, Hugh of Italy and Boso of Tuscany. After Theobald's death, between 895 and 898 she married Adalbert II of Tuscany (c. 875–915) They had at least three children: Guy, who succeeded his father as count and duke of Lucca and margrave of Tuscany, Lambert succeeded his brother in 929, but lost the titles in 931 to his half-brother Boso of Tuscany, and Ermengard.\nErmengarde (d. 90?)\nOdo (d. c.879)\nPassage 2:\nFrancis I Rákóczi\nFrancis I Rákóczi (February 24, 1645, Gyulafehérvár, Transylvania – July 8, 1676, Zboró, Royal Hungary) was a Hungarian aristocrat, elected prince of Transylvania and father of Hungarian national hero Francis Rákóczi II.Francis Rákóczi was the son of George Rákóczi II, prince of Transylvania, and Sophia Báthory.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane.\nThis is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes.\nWhile building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built.\nFirst understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.\nSecond, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain.\nInitially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock.\nThis method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time. If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later.\nLayout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing.\nThe main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately.\nLayout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid", "acc_len": 2.739612188365651}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nFitz and The Tantrums\nFitz and the Tantrums are an American indie pop and neo soul band from Los Angeles, California, that formed in 2008. The band consists of Michael Fitzpatrick (lead vocals), Noelle Scaggs (co-lead vocals and percussion), James King (saxophone, flute, keyboard, percussion and guitar), Joseph Karnes (bass guitar), Jeremy Ruzumna (keyboards) and John Wicks (drums and percussion) who left the band in 2022 to teach at University of Montana. Their debut studio album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, was released in August 2010 on indie label Dangerbird Records and received critical acclaim. It reached no. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The band signed to their current label Elektra Records in early 2013 and went on to release their second LP, More Than Just a Dream, the same year. Their self-titled third album was released in 2016, which contains their most notable song, \"HandClap\". Their fourth studio album, All the Feels, was released in 2019.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nFitz and the Tantrums was founded by Michael Fitzpatrick in 2008. Having purchased an old Conn electronic organ, he was inspired to write the song \"Breakin' the Chains of Love\" that same night. He contacted his college friend, saxophonist James King, who recommended singer Noelle Scaggs and former drummer John Wicks who left the band in 2022. In turn, King brought in bassist Joseph Karnes and keyboardist Jeremy Ruzumna. According to Fitzpatrick, the band immediately clicked. He has said, \"It was literally like five phone calls, one rehearsal, and we could have played a show that night.\" The band performed their first show at Hotel Café in Hollywood, in December 2008, which Fitzpatrick booked one week after their first rehearsal. In interviews, he has stated the importance of booking a date before the band was ready, in order to bring out the best in all performers. During the first half of 2009, they performed at several clubs in Los Angeles, including The Viper Room and Spaceland. Before Joseph Karnes was brought into the band, the previous bassist, Ethan Phillips was with the band for the first EP, and a part of their first album, \"Pickin' Up The Pieces\".\n\nThe band recorded their debut EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, during the first half of 2009 at Fitzpatrick's home in Los Angeles. The EP was first released on August 11, 2009, through Canyon Productions. In September 2009 they toured with Hepcat and Flogging Molly. In November 2009 the band opened eight concerts on the Maroon 5's Back to School Tour. Their appearance was on short notice, after previously scheduled opener K'naan cancelled due to fatigue in late October. According to Fitzpatrick, \"Adam Levine from Maroon 5 was in New York to get a tattoo, and his favorite tattoo artist had downloaded the record after hearing us on the radio. He told Adam, 'you gotta hear this band.' A week and a half later, we're opening for Maroon 5 on their college tour.\" In December 2009 the band shot the official music video for their first single, \"Breakin' the Chains of Love\", which was directed by Joshua Leonard. It features Fitzpatrick and Scaggs in a moving and rotating bed.\n\nPickin' Up the Pieces\nIn March 2010 Fitz and the Tantrums played at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. On April 15, 2010, they opened for ska band The Specials on their North American reunion tour at Club Nokia in Los Angeles. On April 26, 2010, Dangerbird Records announced that they had signed Fitz and the Tantrums. Their first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, was released on August 24, 2010. Producer Chris Seefried was also a co-writer on the album. In October 2010, Daryl Hall invited the band to perform on his web-series Live from Daryl's House. They played a seven-song set including four Fitz and the Tantrums songs, early Hall song \"Girl I Love You\", \"Perkiomen\" and finishing with \"Sara Smile\". \"I walked back into the kitchen of his big old house in upstate New York, and his mother was there,\" recalled Fitzpatrick. \"She said, 'Fitz, come over here. You sound just like my son!'\"\nThe band performed the songs \"MoneyGrabber\" and \"Don't Gotta Work It Out\" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! in Los Angeles on January 12, 2011. On February 28 they performed \"MoneyGrab", "acc_len": 2.742382271468144}

They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed), in 1995. Natalie falls in love with Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both spina bifida and hydrocephalus; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son Liam on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, Ricky becomes acquainted with Bianca's mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and her boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). He quickly gets along with the pair, but this changes when Carol tells him that Bianca and Dan have embarked on an affair - as the pair had previously had a relationship in Spain, prior to Dan falling in love with Carol. When the affair becomes public knowledge, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Ricky, devastated by his marriage breakdown, begins to clash with Dan when the latter taunts him - as well as becoming unhappy with his own life and work. This escalates when Ricky learns that Phil has recently befriended Dan, who later tells Ricky that Phil and Roy have been working together on a motor scam. In response, Ricky confronts Phil and the two have an argument as Ricky attempts to leave Walford. Phil apologizes to Ricky for hurting him and promises that he'll deal with Dan for him. Ricky initially agrees to return to Walford, but secretly leaves without Phil's consent.\n\nParagraph 3: At Brega a pro-Gadaffi Mirage F-1ED fighter jet was shot down by the rebel forces on 2 March 2011, thus leaving just one Mirage F-1BD trainer aircraft in possession of Gadaffi's loyalist forces, while that same day one pro-Gadaffi SU-22M-3K was damaged by rebel anti-aircraft fire at Brega (the rebel sources claimed that they shot it down).

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nTrusty system (prison)\nThe \"trusty system\" (sometimes incorrectly called \"trustee system\") was a penitentiary system of discipline and security enforced in parts of the United States until the 1980s, in which designated inmates were given various privileges, abilities, and responsibilities not available to all inmates.It was made compulsory under Mississippi state law but was used in other states as well, such as Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, New York and Texas. The method of controlling and working inmates at Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman was designed in 1901 to replace convict leasing. The case Gates v. Collier ended the flagrant abuse of inmates under the trusty system and other prison abuses that had continued essentially unchanged since the building of the Mississippi State Penitentiary. Other states using the trusty system were also forced to give it up under the ruling.\n\nHistory\nPrisons had trusties as far back as the 1800s.\n\nParchman Farm\nThe prison had approximately 16,000 acres (65 km2) of farmland and grew such cash crops as cotton as well as engaged in livestock production. Although the population of the prison was around 1,900 inmates (two thirds of whom were black and in racially-segregated units), the law allowed only a maximum of 150 staff members to be hired to minimize operating costs. Thus, the farm labor was done by inmates.The bulk of guarding and disciplining of the inmates was performed by inmate trusties. They also performed most of the administrative work, supervised by a few employees. Therefore, the inmate trusties essentially controlled inmate care and custody, basically running the prison system.Highest in the prison inmate hierarchy were the inmates armed with rifles, called the \"trusty shooters\". Their job was to act as prison guards and control other inmates on a day-to-day basis in the residential camps or out on the field work crews. Next came the unarmed trusties who performed janitorial, clerical, and other menial tasks for the prison's staff. Simple tasks, such as distributing medication, were carried out by other categories of inmates such as \"hallboys\". Inmate trusties enforced discipline within the prison inmate living quarters (16 different residential camps) and in the work camps and prison farms. In addition to punishment administered on site, inmate trusties could recommend further punishment in the special punishment area for disobedient or disruptive inmates.According to attorney Roy Haber, who handled the series of litigation cases brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the trusty system, inmates were whipped with leather straps for failing to pick their daily quota of cotton. The farm's camps of black inmates were supervised by one white sergeant, and under him the black inmate \"trusty shooters\", who were serving sentences for murder, carried rifles and enforced discipline.\n\nAbolition\nGates v. Collier (Gates v. Collier Prison Reform Case, 1970–1971) ended the flagrant abuse of inmates under the trusty system and other prison abuses that had continued essentially unchanged since the building of the prison in 1903. On October 20, 1972, Federal Judge William Keady ordered the end of racial segregation in prison residential quarters. He also required replacement of trusty shooters with civilian prison guards.Any system in which inmates were allowed to be in a position of authority and control other inmates or to use physical abuse or intimidation of other inmates was abolished. It also found some types of corporal punishment were a violation of an inmate's Eighth Amendment rights, including \"handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for, long periods of time,... and forcing inmates to stand, sit or lie on crates, stumps, or otherwise maintain awkward positions for prolonged periods.\"Its structure and abuses were detailed in Hope v. Pelzer in which a former inmate sued the prison superintendent for personal injury suffered under the trusty system.Other states using the trusty system, such as Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas were also forced to abolish it under the Gates v. Collier rulings. However, some states, such as Texas, still continued their use of trusty systems (known as \"building tenders\") until the 1980s, when Federal Judge William Wayne Justice, in Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265 (S.D. Tex. 1980), compelled the replacement of the trusty system with the strictly-regulated Support Service Inmate (SSI) system.\n\nSee also\n\"Parchman Farm\" (song)\nLouisiana State Penitentiary\nKapo\nPassage 2:\nBrockmeyer v.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All the while, police looked on calmly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police had no plans to evict anyone, Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said about 6:30 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sullivan cautioned, however, that protesters would be prevented from setting up another camp elsewhere in the city unless they got a permit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city has said it needs to erect fencing this week for work at Dilworth Plaza, including renovation of the SEPTA tunnels and the addition of grass, a cafe, stage, and winter ice rink. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the last few days, Occupy Philly participants, many homeless, had begun to take down their tents. By 7:15 p.m. Sunday, roughly a third of what originally was about 300 tents were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Darrin Annussek, an unemployed career counselor, and William Tuttle, a student, were folding up Annussek's tent Sunday. Someone had stolen Tuttle's tent, and the men, who got married at Occupy Philly last month, said they probably would move to the Occupy site in Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I wanted to protest the fact that corporations have too much control and government hasn't done much to stop it,\" Annussek said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he believed Nutter had exaggerated the health and safety concerns the mayor cited in explaining why he could not issue protesters a permit for a new location once the $50 million renovation project began. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I really thought this would become one of the longer occupations,\" Annussek said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ellen Rogovinhart of Elkins Park said she thought the city could have done more to help the Occupiers find a new location, possibly in a church.

Working together, these two groups destroyed the VTOL and killed the Commander to weaken Division operations in New York. Intercepting a signal from the Russian consulate, the agents attempt to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a Russian virologist who claims to have information on the Green Poison.

Lau informs the agent that most threats are destroyed or weakened, however the LMB was split into factions. New York is approaching stability, but an unknown signal leads the agent to a secluded laboratory. There, they find Dr. Amherst's remains, having discovered that he has died from exposure to his own virus. They also find a message from Keener, showing he has the technology to manufacture a new strain of Green Poison and intends to do so, and mysteriously tells the agent to explore the center of Manhattan, called the “Dark Zone.” The agent is informed that the information in the lab will further the development of a vaccine and is shown a recovered message from Amherst.

First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nCigarette smoke has long been known to have a multitude of damaging effects, but thanks to recent research we now know it also fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia. Originating as a strain of staph infection, MRSA becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. A disastrous diagnosis due to its innate difficulty to treat, it has become even more threatening with the addition of smoking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, in a press release. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, sought to find potential ties between the increased occurrences of MRSA cases in smokers. In order to do so, Crotty Alexander and her team tested two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to see how each group responded to the defenses of our immune system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Macrophages, or immune cells known to devour infectious ages, were infected with both types of MRSA (smoke exposed and not) to test the immune response. Although both were able to take up the populations of MRSA, macrophages fighting MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time killing them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that this type of MRSA was more resistant to the reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria. MRSA exposed to smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation. Even more alarming was researchers’ discovery that MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, assisting in the success of their invasion. This effect depended strongly on dose; the more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ultimately, the data suggest that through altering the cell walls of the bacteria, cigarette smoke allows MRSA to repel common forms of immune responses. Another study conducted by researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke; vaporized smoke can also alter the structure of MRSA’s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria. However, this research also discovered that surface changes to the bacteria increased 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor,\" Crotty Alexander said. Through their finding, Crotty Alexander and her team hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Paragraph 1: In Irish service, the ship took her name from Saint Ciara, born in Tipperary in the 7th century who, after taking religious vows in her teens, founded a convent in Kilkeary, near Nenagh. The ship's coat-of-arms depict three golden chalices which represent the three ancient dioceses among which Tipperary was divided. Also featured is a Celtic cross as a representation of the North Cross at Ahenny, County Tipperary. The coat of arms incorporates the Tipperary colours of Blue and Yellow as well as the background or field colours of the Tipperary Arms which is Ermine - white with a pattern of black arrowhead shaped points.\n\nParagraph 2: New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C.  It was intended to begin at the Potomac River and extend northeast toward the White House, then continue past the Executive Residence northeast to the boundary of the Federal City. The portion of the street southwest of the White House was to give the President of the United States an uninterrupted view of the river. Construction of the State, War, and Navy Building from 1871 to 1888 blocked this view, and it remains blocked to this day. Originally, it extended to the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the construction of Rawlins Park in 1873 destroyed a block of New York Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets NW. Its consolidation with Triangle Park and three other \"parklets\" into a \"Little Mall\" (in apparent imitation of the nearby National Mall) in 1937 consumed another block between 20th and 21st Streets NW. Construction of the United States Department of War Building (now the Harry S Truman Building, housing the United States Department of State), and an associated park (since January 1959, known as Edward J. Kelly Park) from 1940 to 1941 destroyed the lower three blocks of New York Avenue. Construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (which now houses the United States Office of Personnel Management) in 1963 eliminated another block between 19th and 20th Streets NW.  This left a single block of New York Avenue NW, between 17th and 18th Streets NW, southeast of the White House.\n\nParagraph 3: If a small freight or commuter railroad does not operate on another railroad territory, then there is no interoperability-based reason that obligates them to use  spectrum to implement PTC. In addition, if a small freight or commuter railroad only operates on their own territory and hosts other guest railroads (freight or other passenger rail), there is still no interoperability-based reason the host is obliged to use  spectrum to implement PTC. Such a railroad could implement PTC by freely picking any radio spectrum and requiring the guest railroads to either install compliant PTC equipment (including radios) on board their trains or provide wayside equipment for their guest PTC implementation to be installed on the host railroad property. An interesting case that highlights some of these issues is the northeast corridor. Amtrak operates services on two commuter rail properties it does not own: Metro-North Railroad (owned by New York and Connecticut) and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) (owned by Massachusetts). In theory, Amtrak could have found themselves installing their own PTC system on these host properties (about 15 percent of the corridor), or worse, found themselves in the ridiculous position of trying to install three different PTC systems on each Amtrak train to traverse the commuter properties. This was not the case. Amtrak had a significant head start over the commuter rail agencies on the corridor in implementing PTC. They spent a considerable amount of time in research and development and won early approvals for their ACSES system on the northeast corridor with the FRA. They chose first to use  and then later moved to , in part because of a perceived improvement in radio-system performance and in part because Amtrak was using  in Michigan for their ITCS implementation.  When the commuter agencies on the corridor looked at options for implementing PTC, many of them chose to take advantage of the advance work Amtrak had done and implement the ACSES solution using . Amtrak's early work paid off and meant that they would be traversing commuter properties that installed the same protocol at the same frequency, making them all interoperable. (Actually most of the Northeast Corridor is owned and operated by Amtrak, not the commuter properties, including the tracks from Washington, D.C. to New York Penn Station and the tracks from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The State of Massachusetts owns the tracks from the Rhode Island state line to the New Hampshire state line, but Amtrak \"operates\" these lines. Only the line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut is actually owned and operated by a commuter line.)\n\nParagraph 4: Born in Stratford,  Tomlinson completed preparatory", "acc_len": 2.912772585669782}
