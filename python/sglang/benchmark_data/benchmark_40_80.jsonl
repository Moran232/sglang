{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage:\nAdam's apple\nThe laryngeal prominence (commonly referred to as Adam's apple), a feature of the human neck, is the lump or protrusion that is formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx.\n\nStructure\n\nThe structure of the laryngeal prominence forms a bump under the skin. It is larger in adult men, in whom it is usually clearly visible and palpable. In women, the bump is much less visible and is hardly perceived on the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. \n\nThe meeting point of the two portions of the cartilage generally forms an acute angle (of about 90°) in men, while in women it forms an open arc (of about 120°).\n\nSex difference\n\nAlthough both sexes have it, the Adam's apple is considered to be a characteristic feature of adult men, because its size tends to increase considerably during puberty. \n\nIts development is considered a secondary sexual characteristic of males that appears as a result of hormonal activity. Its level of development varies among individuals and the widening of that area in the larynx can occur very suddenly and quickly.\n\nThe laryngeal prominence is more prominent in adult males than in females because of the difference in the size of the angle: 90° in males and 120° in females.\n\nFunction \n\nThe Adam's apple, in conjunction with the thyroid cartilage which forms it, helps to protect the walls and the frontal part of the larynx, including the vocal cords (which are located directly behind it). It is found in both women and men.\n\nAnother function of the laryngeal prominence is related to the deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal prominence grows in size mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation apparatus and, as a result, the man gets a deeper voice note.  \n\nSociety and culture\n\nCosmetic surgery to reduce the size of laryngeal prominence is called chondrolaryngoplasty (thyroid chondroplasty).  The surgery is effective, such that complications tend to be few and, if present, transient. \n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are two main theories as to the origin of the term \"Adam's apple\". \nThe \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" and the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary point at an ancient belief that a piece of forbidden fruit was embedded in Adam's throat (the first man, according to Abrahamic religions).  However, neither the Bible nor other Judeo-Christian Islamic writings mention such a story. In fact, the biblical story does not even specify the type of fruit that Adam ate. \n\nLinguist Alexander Gode claimed that the Latin phrase to designate the laryngeal prominence was very probably translated incorrectly from the beginning. The phrase in Latin was \"pomum Adami\" (literally: 'Adam's apple'). This, in turn, came from the Hebrew \"tappuach ha adam\" meaning \"apple of man\". The confusion lies in the fact that in Hebrew language the proper name \"Adam\" (אדם) literally means \"man\", while the late Hebrew word used to refer  \"bump\" is very similar to the word used to refer \"apple\".   Proponents of this version contend that the subsequent phrases in Latin and other Romance languages represent a mistranslation from the start. \n\nThe medical term \"prominentia laryngea\" was introduced by the Basle Nomina Anatomica in 1895. \n\nIn the American South, goozle is used colloquially to describe the Adam's apple, likely derived from guzzle.    \n\nAdditional images\n\nFile:Slide9lll.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nFile:Slide5mmm.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nFile:Slide7ooo.JPG|Laryngeal prominence\nQuestion:\nWhat is the common name for the laryngeal prominence in the body?\nAnswer:\nAdams Apple\nPassage:\nUranophobia\nFear of heaven, also known by its Greek-derived name uranophobia or ouranophobia, is a phobia that makes its sufferer fear heaven or the sky. \n\nThe origin of the word urano is Greek, meaning heaven, while phobia is Greek for fear.\n\nCauses\n\nThe causes of Uranophobia, as with other phobias, can be linked to a combination of external events and internal susceptibility - of brain chemistry and life experiences.\n\nFear of heaven may more specifically be related to the dread of punishment in the afterlife.  Psychoanalysis would see this as an animistic projection of the threatening and punitive powers of the parents  - heaven or the sky being a relatively late stage in the detachment of the superego from the actual parents. \n\nJewish tradition\n\nJewish tradition highly valorised the fear of heaven, seeing it as a positive force linked both to wisdom and to personal humility. \n\nLiterary examples\n\nW.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nSince humans amass more and more generally available data in the form of unstructured text it would be very useful to teach machines to read and comprehend such data and then use this understanding to answer our questions. A significant amount of research has recently focused on answering one particular kind of questions the answer to which depends on understanding a context document. These are cloze-style questions BIBREF0 which require the reader to fill in a missing word in a sentence. An important advantage of such questions is that they can be generated automatically from a suitable text corpus which allows us to produce a practically unlimited amount of them. That opens the task to notoriously data-hungry deep-learning techniques which now seem to outperform all alternative approaches.\nTwo such large-scale datasets have recently been proposed by researchers from Google DeepMind and Facebook AI: the CNN/Daily Mail dataset BIBREF1 and the Children's Book Test (CBT) BIBREF2 respectively. These have attracted a lot of attention from the research community BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 with a new state-of-the-art model coming out every few weeks.\nHowever if our goal is a production-level system actually capable of helping humans, we want the model to use all available resources as efficiently as possible. Given that\nwe believe that if the community is striving to bring the performance as far as possible, it should move its work to larger data.\nThis thinking goes in line with recent developments in the area of language modelling. For a long time models were being compared on several \"standard\" datasets with publications often presenting minuscule improvements in performance. Then the large-scale One Billion Word corpus dataset appeared BIBREF15 and it allowed Jozefowicz et al. to train much larger LSTM models BIBREF16 that almost halved the state-of-the-art perplexity on this dataset.\nWe think it is time to make a similar step in the area of text comprehension. Hence we are introducing the BookTest, a new dataset very similar to the Children's Book test but more than 60 times larger to enable training larger models even in the domain of text comprehension. Furthermore the methodology used to create our data can later be used to create even larger datasets when the need arises thanks to further technological progress.\nWe show that if we evaluate a model trained on the new dataset on the now standard Children's Book Test dataset, we see an improvement in accuracy much larger than other research groups achieved by enhancing the model architecture itself (while still using the original CBT training data). By training on the new dataset, we reduce the prediction error by almost one third. On the named-entity version of CBT this brings the ensemble of our models to the level of human baseline as reported by Facebook BIBREF2 . However in the final section we show in our own human study that there is still room for improvement on the CBT beyond the performance of our model.\nTask Description\nA natural way of testing a reader's comprehension of a text is to ask her a question the answer to which can be deduced from the text. Hence the task we are trying to solve consists of answering a cloze-style question, the answer to which depends on the understanding of a context document provided with the question. The model is also provided with a set of possible answers from which the correct one is to be selected. This can be formalized as follows:\nThe training data consist of tuples INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is a question, INLINEFORM2 is a document that contains the answer to question INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 is a set of possible answers and INLINEFORM5 is the ground-truth answer. Both INLINEFORM6 and INLINEFORM7 are sequences of words from vocabulary INLINEFORM8 . We also assume that all possible answers are words from the vocabulary, that is INLINEFORM9 . In the CBT and CNN/Daily Mail datasets it is also true that the ground-truth answer INLINEFORM10 appears in the document. This is exploited by many machine learning models BIBREF2 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , however some do not explicitly depend on this property BIBREF1 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF9\nCurrent Landscape\nWe will now briefly review what datasets for text comprehension have been published up to date and look at models which have been recently applied to solving the task we have just described.\nDatasets\nA crucial condition for applying deep-learning techniques is to have a huge amount of data available for training. For question answering this specifically means having a large number of document-question-answer triples available. While there is an unlimited amount of text available,", "acc_len": 2.4064837905236907}

His U.S. hits included \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" (1971), and his reputation as a Northern soul artist in the UK was secured by \"A Little Piece of Leather\", a performance highlighting his powerful falsetto voice.\n\nCareer\nElbert was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but when aged three his family relocated to Buffalo, New York. He learned to play guitar and piano as a child, and in 1955 formed a doo-wop group, the Vibraharps, with friend Danny Cannon. Elbert acted as the group's guitarist, songwriter, arranger, and background vocalist, making his recording debut on their single \"Walk Beside Me\". He left the group in 1957 for a solo career, and recorded a demonstration record that earned him a recording contract with the King label's DeLuxe subsidiary. His solo debut \"What Can I Do?\" reached #12 in the U.S. R&B chart, and he followed it up with the less successful \"Believe It or Not\" and \"Have I Sinned?\", which became a regional hit in Pittsburgh.He continued to release singles on DeLuxe, but with little commercial success, and also played New York's Apollo Theater and toured the Chitlin' Circuit of African-American owned nightclubs. After completing an album, The Sensational Donnie Elbert Sings, he left DeLuxe in 1959, joining first Red Top Records, where in 1960 he recorded \"Someday (You'll Want Me to Want You)\", and then Vee-Jay Records, where he had another regional hit with \"Will You Ever Be Mine?\", which reportedly sold 250,000 copies in the Philadelphia area but failed to take off nationwide. His career was also interrupted by a spell in the US Army, from which he was discharged in 1961. He then recorded singles for several labels, including Parkway, Cub and Checker, but with little success. However, although the 1965 Gateway label release of \"A Little Piece of Leather\" failed to chart in the US, the record became a #27 pop hit when released on the London label in the UK several years later in 1972, and remains a Northern soul favorite.Elbert relocated to the UK in 1966, where he married. There, he recorded \"In Between The Heartaches\" for the Polydor label in 1968, a cover version of the Supremes' hit \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" and an album of Otis Redding cover versions, Tribute To A King. His 1969 Deram release \"Without You\" had a rocksteady rhythm, and went to the top of the Jamaican charts.\nHe returned to the US the same year and had his first US chart hit in over a decade with the Rare Bullet release, \"Can't Get Over Losing You\", which reached #26 on the Billboard R&B chart. The track and its b-side, \"Got To Get Myself Together\", both written by Elbert, were released several times on different labels in subsequent years. After the success of that record, Elbert moved labels for a re-make of the Supremes' 1964 hit, \"Where Did Our Love Go?\" on All Platinum. It became his biggest hit, reaching #15 on the Billboard pop chart, #6 on the R&B chart, and (in 1972) #8 in the UK. Its follow-up, \"Sweet Baby\" reached #30 on the R&B chart in early 1972.\nElbert then signed with Avco-Embassy, where he entered the recording studio with the successful production team of Hugo & Luigi. His cover of the Four Tops' \"I Can't Help Myself\" reached #14 on the Billboard R&B chart, but climbed as high as #2 on the alternative Cashbox R&B chart. Elbert baulked at the label's insistence that he record material associated with Motown and departed with only a few tracks left to record for an album. Even so, the album was released after Avco sold it on to a budget label, Trip.\nHe returned to All Platinum and had a run of minor R&B hits, but left after a disagreement over the claimed authorship of Shirley & Company's R&B chart-topper \"Shame Shame Shame\", which was credited to label owner Sylvia Robinson. Elbert was also involved in a copyright wrangle over Darrell Banks' major R&B and pop hit in 1966, \"Open The Door To Your Heart\". He had originally written the song as \"Baby Walk Right In\" (still its alternative legal title) and given it to Banks, but received no", "acc_len": 2.423940149625935}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>The inventories of the selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in our review totaled 2,823 aircraft and required approximately $20 billion to operate and support in fiscal year 2016. The inventory, aircraft status, initial operational capability, and service life forecast for each of the 12 selected fixed-wing aircraft are shown in figure 1. Sustainment of fixed-wing aircraft and other weapon systems comprises the logistics and personnel services required to maintain and prolong operations, and DOD policy provides direction to service components on sustainment planning across the life cycle of the weapon system. Specifically, DOD policy requires the services to develop and implement a sustainment strategy, such as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, for sustaining its weapon systems. According to DOD’s policy, this strategy should be the basis for all sustainment efforts, including sustainment metrics mapped to key performance parameters and key system attributes, such as aircraft availability, to manage sustainment performance. The policy states that, after initial operating capability, programs should update the sustainment plan whenever there are major changes to its strategy for sustaining the weapon system, or every 5 years, whichever occurs first. The Air Force and the Navy also have guidance that implements the requirements of the DOD guidance. These services’ guidance include sustainment-planning requirements for life-cycle sustainment and assurance of affordability. There are a variety of DOD offices that have roles and responsibilities related to sustaining fixed-wing aircraft. For instance, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD ), is the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense for all matters concerning acquisition and sustainment. Specifically, USD (A&S) is responsible for establishing policies for logistics, maintenance, and sustainment support for all elements of DOD, including fixed-wing aircraft. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness (ASD ) serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the USD (A&S) on logistics and materiel readiness within DOD. Specifically, the ASD (L&MR) is responsible for (1) establishing DOD policies and procedures for logistics, maintenance, materiel readiness, strategic mobility, and sustainment support; (2) providing related guidance to the Secretaries of the military departments, including developing the Life- cycle Sustainment Plan outline; and (3) monitoring and reviewing programs associated with these areas, among other duties and responsibilities. For the Air Force, the Air Force Materiel Command develops, acquires, and sustains weapon systems through research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, maintenance, and program management of the systems and their components. This command provides acquisition and life-cycle management services and logistics support, among other things. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center within the Air Force Materiel Command is responsible for the life-cycle management of weapon systems from inception to retirement. A Program Executive Officer—responsible for managing a specific portfolio of weapon systems—is responsible for each of the selected fixed-wing aircraft. The Program Executive Officer oversees the program office that manages each weapon system. For the Navy and Marine Corps, the Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for providing the full life-cycle support of naval aviation aircraft, weapons, and systems. This support includes research, design, development and systems engineering; acquisition; test and evaluation; training facilities and equipment; repair and modification; and in-service engineering and logistics support. As with the Air Force, Program Executive Officers oversee their assigned program managers. DOD relies on program managers to lead the development, delivery, and sustainment of individual weapon systems through their life cycles. The program managers are the designated individuals with responsibility for and authority to accomplish the program’s sustainment objectives to meet the users’ operational needs. Product support managers, who work within the program offices, are responsible for developing and implementing support strategies for weapon systems that maintain readiness and control life-cycle costs. Weapon systems are sustained under various arrangements that may include contractors, DOD organic facilities, or some combination of the two. For example, the Air Force Sustainment Center provides depot maintenance through its Air Logistics Complexes for weapon systems. Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for the Navy Fleet Readiness Centers, which provide depot-level maintenance for Navy and Marine Corps fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, the Air Force Sustainment Center and the Navy Supply Systems Command, as well as the Defense Logistics Agency, manage inventories of repair parts, and individual weapon systems programs are typically supported by a complex supplier network that includes a prime contractor, subcontractors, and various tiers of parts suppliers. On the other hand, sustainment responsibilities—in their entirety or particular elements—may be contracted out as part of a public-private partnership or a performance-based logistics agreement, such as with the F-22 Raptor. The Air Force and Navy monitor the readiness status of selected fixed- wing aircraft through numerous performance metrics. Specifically, the Air Force measures how well a fleet is performing by calculating the availability of the fleets’ aircraft, which is the number of aircraft that are available for flight operations. The Navy measures its aircraft availability through two metrics:", "acc_len": 2.428927680798005}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nRecently, deep learning algorithms have successfully addressed problems in various fields, such as image classification, machine translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech generation and other machine learning related areas BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . Similarly, substantial improvements in performance have been obtained when deep learning algorithms have been applied to statistical speech processing BIBREF3 . These fundamental improvements have led researchers to investigate additional topics related to human nature, which have long been objects of study. One such topic involves understanding human emotions and reflecting it through machine intelligence, such as emotional dialogue models BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 .\nIn developing emotionally aware intelligence, the very first step is building robust emotion classifiers that display good performance regardless of the application; this outcome is considered to be one of the fundamental research goals in affective computing BIBREF6 . In particular, the speech emotion recognition task is one of the most important problems in the field of paralinguistics. This field has recently broadened its applications, as it is a crucial factor in optimal human-computer interactions, including dialog systems. The goal of speech emotion recognition is to predict the emotional content of speech and to classify speech according to one of several labels (i.e., happy, sad, neutral, and angry). Various types of deep learning methods have been applied to increase the performance of emotion classifiers; however, this task is still considered to be challenging for several reasons. First, insufficient data for training complex neural network-based models are available, due to the costs associated with human involvement. Second, the characteristics of emotions must be learned from low-level speech signals. Feature-based models display limited skills when applied to this problem.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a model that uses high-level text transcription, as well as low-level audio signals, to utilize the information contained within low-resource datasets to a greater degree. Given recent improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology BIBREF7 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , speech transcription can be carried out using audio signals with considerable skill. The emotional content of speech is clearly indicated by the emotion words contained in a sentence BIBREF10 , such as “lovely” and “awesome,” which carry strong emotions compared to generic (non-emotion) words, such as “person” and “day.” Thus, we hypothesize that the speech emotion recognition model will be benefit from the incorporation of high-level textual input.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that simultaneously utilizes audio and text data in recognizing emotions from speech. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 68.8% to 71.8% when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, which is one of the most well-studied datasets. Based on an error analysis of the models, we show that our proposed model accurately identifies emotion classes. Moreover, the neutral class misclassification bias frequently exhibited by previous models, which focus on audio features, is less pronounced in our model.\nRelated work\nClassical machine learning algorithms, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), support vector machines (SVMs), and decision tree-based methods, have been employed in speech emotion recognition problems BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . Recently, researchers have proposed various neural network-based architectures to improve the performance of speech emotion recognition. An initial study utilized deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract high-level features from raw audio data and demonstrated its effectiveness in speech emotion recognition BIBREF14 . With the advancement of deep learning methods, more complex neural-based architectures have been proposed. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models have been trained on information derived from raw audio signals using spectrograms or audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and low-level descriptors (LLDs) BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . These neural network-based models are combined to produce higher-complexity models BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , and these models achieved the best-recorded performance when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset.\nAnother line of research has focused on adopting variant machine learning techniques combined with neural network-based models. One researcher utilized the multiobject learning approach and used gender and naturalness as auxiliary tasks so that the neural network-based model learned more features from a given dataset BIBREF20 . Another researcher investigated transfer learning methods, leveraging external data from related domains BIBREF21 .\nAs emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, researchers have also investigated the combination of acoustic features and language information, built belief network-based methods of identifying emotional key phrases, and assessed the emotional salience of verbal cues from both phoneme sequences and words BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . However, none of these studies have utilized information from speech signals and text sequences simultaneously in an end-to-end learning neural network", "acc_len": 2.43142144638404}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ellen Pao leaves San Francisco Superior Court Civic Center Courthouse during a lunch break in San Francisco, California March 25, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jury cleared Kleiner Perkins in March of claims it short-circuited former partner Ellen Pao’s career because she is a woman. The trial helped spark a wide discussion about gender at the center of the U.S. technology industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner has offered to waive its legal costs should Pao choose not to appeal, according to firm spokeswoman Christina Lee. Kleiner’s costs request includes about $865,000 in expert witness fees, the court filing said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,” Lee said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao and her legal team are considering the proposal, said Heather Wilson, a spokeswoman for Pao. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao, now interim chief executive at social-news service Reddit, claimed her standing at Kleiner Perkins crumbled after she ended a brief affair with a partner. Her career deteriorated after he and Kleiner Perkins started retaliating against her in a climate that was overall unfriendly toward women, her lawyers argued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the verdict, three jurors told Reuters they had focused on Pao’s increasingly negative performance reviews, which undermined her argument that she deserved to be promoted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner’s offer to withdraw its costs request in exchange for an end to the case, is common when defendants prevail in employment lawsuits. Should Pao decide to pursue an appeal, her case would be heard by California’s First District Court of Appeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Westlaw data, out of 49 decisions involving discrimination and retaliation over the past two years, the First District affirmed 26 of 31 cases where the employer won in the trial court, or 84 percent. Only five cases were reversed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile the court, which covers San Francisco and 11 other Northern California counties, handed victory to employers in more than half of the cases they lost in the lower courts, reversing 10 of 18 cases.\nPassage 2:\nSAN FRANCISCO — Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm, is offering a new deal to the former associate who unsuccessfully sued the firm, accusing it of gender discrimination: Promise not to pursue this case any further or pay us $1 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The offer was made in papers filed this week in California Superior Court in San Francisco. The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition and court reporter costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the winning party, Kleiner is asking the former associate, Ellen Pao, to reimburse it for these bills. But if she forgoes any appeal and lets the case die, the firm will forgive and forget, or at least move on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,” said Christina Lee, a Kleiner spokeswoman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jury at the end of March rejected all of Ms. Pao’s claims. Legal fees, which must have been considerable on both sides, are not on the table.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact federal entities and the information they maintain. According to OMB’s 2018 annual FISMA report to Congress, agencies reported 35,277 information security incidents to DHS’s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) in fiscal year 2017. As shown in figure 1, these incidents involved threat vectors, such as web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and the loss or theft of computer equipment, among others. These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The following examples highlight the impact of such incidents: In March 2018, the Department of Justice reported that it had indicted nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to the department, the Iranians allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 U.S. companies, and 5 federal government agencies, among other entities. In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated that, since at least March 2016, Russian government actors had targeted U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors. In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management reported that an intrusion into its systems had affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a separate but related incident had compromised its systems and the files related to background investigations for at least 21.5 million individuals. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is prescribed by federal law and policy. FISMA sets requirements for effectively securing federal systems and information. In addition, the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires protecting federal networks through the use of federal intrusion prevention and detection capabilities. Further, Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, directs agencies to manage cybersecurity risks to the federal enterprise by, among other things, using the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (cybersecurity framework). FISMA was enacted to improve federal cybersecurity and clarify government-wide responsibilities. The law is intended to provide for improved oversight of federal agencies’ information security programs. Specifically, the law provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets. The law is also intended to ensure the effective oversight of information security risks, including those throughout civilian, national security, and law enforcement agencies. FISMA assigns OMB and DHS oversight roles in ensuring federal agencies’ compliance with the law. Among other things, FISMA requires OMB to develop and oversee the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies, except with regard to national security systems. The law also assigns OMB the responsibility of requiring agencies to identify and provide information security protections commensurate with assessments of risk to their information and information systems. The law further requires DHS to administer the implementation of agency information security policies and practices for non-national security information systems, in consultation with OMB, by developing, issuing, and overseeing implementation of binding operational directives; monitoring agency implementation of information security policies and practices; and convening meetings with senior agency officials to help ensure their effective implementation of information security policies and practices, among other things. FISMA assigned to NIST the responsibility for developing standards and guidelines that include minimum information security requirements. To this end, NIST has issued several publications to provide guidance for agencies in implementing an information security program. For example, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 provides guidance to agencies on the selection and implementation of information security and privacy controls for systems. FISMA also assigns to the head of each executive branch agency, responsibility for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. The law also delegates to the agency chief information officer (CIO), or comparable official, the authority to ensure compliance with FISMA requirements. The CIO is responsible for designating a senior agency information security officer whose primary duty is information security. In addition, the law requires agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to secure federal information systems. Specifically, these information security programs are to provide risk-based protections for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency. Further, FISMA requires agencies to comply with DHS binding operational directives, OMB policies and procedures, and NIST federal information processing standards. FISMA also has reporting requirements for OMB and federal agencies. Specifically, OMB is to report annually, in consultation with DHS, on the effectiveness of agency information security policies and practices", "acc_len": 2.4364089775561095}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Paragraph 1: In 2008 Ohio experienced an unintended consequence of a new statute that resulted in a brief period of overlap voting, when absentee voting has started and before the close of voter registration.  This period ran from September 30 until October 6, due to the newly instituted early voting policy. On August 13, 2008, Brunner ordered county election board officials to establish procedures to enable voters who register to be immediately issued an absentee ballot.  Because a voter could show up with only a cell phone bill, give any four digits and claim they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number, and then immediately vote and have such ballots put into the same pool as other votes with no procedure for more rigorous scrutiny of their validity, the Republican Party opposed the same day voting plan and fought it in several Ohio Courts. Ohio Republican Party officials and Republican voters argued in separate lawsuits that Ohio law requires voters to be registered for 30 days before they cast an absentee ballot. On September 29, 2008 (a day after lower state and federal courts overruled GOP objections to same-day registration and voting or GOP requests for mandated ballot segregation and verification) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio rejected Republican efforts to stop the plan. United States district court judge James Gwin in Cleveland, Ohio also ruled against the Republicans and issued a restraining order to enforce Brunner's plan. In Columbus, Ohio, U.S. District Judge George Smith declined to rule on another statewide challenge, deferring to the state Supreme Court's decision. The rulings, which opened a window to register and vote on the same day until the absentee ballot deadline on October 6, 2008, was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 4-3 decision in which two Republican jurists who were on the November 2008 ballot recused themselves and were replaced by one Republican and one Democrat by Chief Justice Thomas Moyer.  The normal roster of Ohio Supreme Court jurists is all Republican and the lone Democrat replacement, William H. Wolff Jr., cast the tie-breaking vote.  The dissenters noted that Ohio's Constitution requires that a person register to vote 30 days in before voting. Brunner ordered segregation of same-day-registration ballots and verification of them before counting them on Election Day, November 4, 2008.  In related proceedings on September 30, 2008, Judge Smith of The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Columbus had granted an Ohio Republican Party request for a restraining order that would mandate election observers during early voting.  Brunner prevailed in the appellate court which ruled that the district court \"abused its discretion\" in granting the restraining order.\n\nParagraph 2: Throughout 1990, the KLF launched a series of singles with an upbeat pop-house sound which they dubbed \"stadium house\". Songs from The White Room soundtrack were re-recorded with rap and more vocals (by guests labelled \"Additional Communicators\"), a sample-heavy pop-rock production and crowd noise samples. The first \"stadium house\" single, \"What Time Is Love? (Live from Trancentral)\", released in October 1990, reached #5 on the UK Singles Chart and hit the top-ten internationally. The follow-up, \"3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)\", was an international top-five hit in January 1991, reaching #1 in the UK and #5 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The album The White Room followed in March 1991, reaching #3 in the UK. A substantial reworking of the aborted soundtrack, the album featured a segued series of \"stadium house\" songs followed by downtempo tracks.The KLF's chart success continued with the single \"Last Train to Trancentral\" hitting number two in the UK, and number three on the Eurochart Hot 100. In December 1991, a re-working of a song from 1987, \"Justified & Ancient\" was released, featuring Tammy Wynette. It was another international hit – peaking at number two in the UK, and number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 – as was \"America: What Time Is Love?\", a hard, guitar-laden reworking of \"What Time Is Love?\". In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by Depeche Mode (\"Policy of Truth\"), the Moody Boys (\"What Is Dub?\"), and Pet Shop Boys (\"So Hard\" from the Behaviour album, and \"It Must Be Obvious\"). Neil Tennant described the process: \"When they did the remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ...

Unstable angina (UA) occurs when fatty deposits (plaques) in a blood vessel rupture or a blood clot forms, blocking or reducing flow through a narrowed artery, suddenly and severely decreasing blood flow to the heart muscle. Unstable angina is not relieved by rest; it’s dangerous and requires emergency medical attention.\nAntiplatelet drugs – Medications that block the formation of blood clots by preventing the clumping of platelets (examples: Plavix, Effient, Brillinta, Ticlid, etc). Heart patients, especially those with implanted stents after PCI, are often prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) which includes one of these prescribed meds along with daily low-dose aspirin.\nAorta – The main artery of the body, carrying blood from the left side of the heart to the arteries of all limbs and organs except the lungs.\nAortic Stenosis: A disease of the heart valves in which the opening of the aortic valve is narrowed. Also called AS.\nAortic valve – One of four valves in the heart, this valve allows blood from the left ventricle to be pumped up (ejected) into the aorta, but prevents blood from returning to the heart once it’s in the aorta.\nAP – Apical Pulse: A central pulse located at the apex (pointy bottom) of the heart.\nApex – the lowest (pointy) tip of the heart that points downward at the base, forming what almost looks like a rounded point.\nApical", "acc_len": 2.4413965087281797}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nJohn Macklin\nJohn Farrell \"Big John\" Macklin (October 17, 1883 – October 10, 1949) was an American football player, coach of football, basketball, baseball and track and field, and a college athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Michigan Agricultural College, now Michigan State University from 1911 to 1915. With a five-year record of 29–5, he has the highest winning percentage of any football coach in Michigan State history. Macklin coached the Michigan State Spartans football team to its first ever victories over Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Penn State. He was also the athletic director at Michigan Agricultural and coached the school's basketball, baseball, and track and field teams. Macklin tallied marks of 48–38 as head basketball coach (1910–1916) and 52–27 as head baseball coach (1911–1915).\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nMacklin was born in Worcester, Massachusetts and attended Worcester High School. He played high school football for four years and was also the captain of Worcester's crew. After graduating from Worcester High School, Macklin attended Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire and then St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, playing football at each school.\n\nPenn\nAfter completing his preparatory education, Macklin enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. Macklin grew to be a giant of a man for his time. He was 6 feet, 7 inches tall and weighed 275 pounds. When Macklin arrived at Penn, one account indicates there were no uniforms large enough to fit him: \"When the big husky appeared on the gridiron the first thing the coaches did was to send for the athletic outfitter, for there was not a suit on the campus that would encompass his frame.\" Macklin played two years at the tackle position for Penn's football team. The Chicago Daily Tribune later wrote: \"For a big man he was remarkably agile and his tackling on the wings and his quickness in getting through to break up plays was the delight of the coaches.\"\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1910, Macklin coached football at a boys' school at Pawling, New York. Macklin's success at Pawling brought him to the attention of Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University), which was in need of a new athletic director and coach. He was hired in January 1911 upon the recommendation of the renowned Penn athletic trainer Mike Murphy. Macklin was the head coach at Michigan State 1911 to 1915 and compiled a record of 29–5. His winning percentage of .853 is the highest in the history of the Michigan State Spartans football program. Macklin's 1913 Michigan State team finished with an undefeated, untied record of 7–0 and outscored opponents by a combined score of 180 to 28. Macklin was the first Michigan State coach to lead the Spartans to football victories over Ohio State (35–20 in 1912), Michigan (12–7 in 1913), Wisconsin (12–7 in 1913), and Penn State (6–3 in 1914). Macklin's 1913 team was also the first racially integrated team in the school's history, as Gideon Smith became the first African-American player for the Spartans.Macklin was also the athletic director and coach of the baseball, men's basketball, and track and field teams. He coached the basketball team from 1910 to 1916 and compiled a 48–38 (.558) record, including a 12–3 record for 1911–12 season. He coached the baseball team from 1911 to 1915, compiling a record of 52–27 (.658).Macklin retired from coaching in March 1916 to enter the coal mining business in Pennsylvania.\n\nLater years and honors\nThe Associated Press in 1949 called Macklin \"the founding father of the big time at Michigan State College.\" When he was hired in 1911, the school was putting on games for $200. When he left, the school received guarantees of $10,000 for games. As athletic director, he also led the effort to build new athletic buildings and a modern gymnasium. In 1935, Michigan State renamed its football stadium Macklin Field in his honor. At the time, Macklin was a coal mine operator living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The name was changed to Macklin Stadium in 1948, and in 1957, Macklin's name was dropped and replaced by the current name, Spartan Stadium.Macklin died at his home in the suburbs of Philadelphia at age 65.\n\nHead coaching record\nFootball\nPassage 2:\nDon Coleman (offensive tackle)\nDon Edwin Coleman (May 4, 1928 – January 30, 2017) was an American football player.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>As reported by the United Nations, the International Criminal Police Organization, and other organizations, wildlife trafficking networks span the globe. These organizations have attempted to measure the value of illegally traded wildlife, but available estimates are subject to uncertainty. In 2016, for example, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reported that various sources estimated the global scale of illegal wildlife trade to be from $7 billion to $23 billion annually. UNEP also estimated that the scale of wildlife crime has increased in recent years in part based on a rise in environmental crime. U.S. trade in wildlife and related products includes a variety of species, such as live reptiles, birds, and mammals, as well as elephant ivory, according to law enforcement reports and government and nongovernmental officials. FWS and NOAA data on wildlife products seized at U.S. ports provide examples of the diversity of illegally traded plants, fish, and wildlife imported into or exported from the United States. For example, from 2007 to 2016, the top 10 plant, fish, and wildlife shipments seized nationally by FWS were coral, crocodiles, conchs, deer, pythons, sea turtles, mollusks, ginseng, clams, and seahorses. During that time, FWS reported that more than one-third of the wildlife shipments it seized were confiscated while being imported from or exported to Mexico (14 percent), China (13 percent), or Canada (9 percent). FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices are responsible for enforcing certain laws and treaties prohibiting wildlife trafficking. FWS Office of Law Enforcement. This office enforces certain U.S. laws and regulations as well as treaties prohibiting the trafficking of terrestrial wildlife, freshwater species, and birds. Among other things, the office aims to prevent the unlawful import, export, and interstate commerce of foreign fish and wildlife, as well as to protect U.S. plants, fish, and wildlife from unlawful exploitation. As of fiscal year 2016, the office had a budget of $74.7 million and employed 205 special agents to investigate wildlife crime, including international and domestic wildlife trafficking rings. Most of these special agents report to one of eight regional offices, which receive national oversight, support, training, and policy guidance from the FWS Office of Law Enforcement headquarters. The office’s headquarters houses a special investigative unit focused on conducting complex, large- scale criminal investigations of wildlife traffickers. In addition, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement has deployed special agents to serve as international attachés at seven U.S. embassies. These attachés provide countertrafficking expertise to embassy staff, work with host government officials to build law enforcement capacity, and contribute directly to casework or criminal investigations of wildlife traffickers. According to FWS data, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement opened more than 7,000 investigations on wildlife trafficking and other illegal activities in fiscal year 2016, including nearly 5,000 cases involving Endangered Species Act violations and nearly 1,500 cases involving Lacey Act violations. FWS Office of Law Enforcement investigations have disrupted wildlife trafficking operations. For example, Operation Crash—an ongoing rhino horn and elephant ivory-trafficking investigation launched in 2011—has led to over 30 convictions and more than $2 million in fines. NOAA Office of Law Enforcement. This office enforces certain U.S. laws and regulations as well as treaties prohibiting the trafficking of marine wildlife, including fish, as well as anadromous fish. Among other things, the office aims to prevent the illegal, unregulated, and unreported harvesting and trade of fish as well as the trafficking of protected marine wildlife. As of fiscal year 2016, the office had a budget of $68.6 million and employed 77 special agents to investigate wildlife crimes within its jurisdiction. These agents report to one of five regional offices, and those offices receive national oversight, support, and policy guidance from the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement headquarters. According to NOAA data, the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement initiated more than 5,000 investigations in fiscal year 2016. About half of those investigations involved violations of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended, and some of the 5,000 investigations involved violations of the Endangered Species Act or the Lacey Act. NOAA Office of Law Enforcement investigations have disrupted wildlife trafficking operations. For example, in fiscal year 2016, a NOAA Office of Law Enforcement investigation led to the conviction of a company and five individuals for illegally trafficking whale bone carvings, walrus ivory carvings, black coral carvings, and other products derived from protected species into the United States. The FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices collaborate with other government agencies and organizations to combat wildlife trafficking. Both agencies work with other federal, state, and tribal law enforcement officers as well as their international counterparts as needed during wildlife trafficking investigations. For example, FWS and NOAA work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,", "acc_len": 2.4613466334164587}

In contrast to the “interesting” story behind her name, Monaliza lived an unpleasant upbringing, which made her grow her anti-social attitude and most importantly an extreme inability to draw a smile. Now, 37 years old, and after 17 years of waiting for her turn to come in the long queue of applicants, Monaliza finally gets a governmental job at the Directorate of Archiving and makes a decision that it's time for her to go out into the world. This makes Afaf (Haifa Al Agha), her older unmarried agoraphobic sister who wants to keep Monaliza by her side, very unhappy. At the same time their outgoing neighbour, Rodaina(Suha Najjar), is trying to marry Monaliza off to her sleazy, older and still unwed brother, Suhail(Haidar Kfouf). Monaliza, fed up by Afaf constantly controlling her life, She tricks her into thinking that she is actually considering the proposal. In the office Monaliza meets Nayfeh (Nadera Omran), a bossy, prejudiced, disagreeable woman who keeps picking on everybody around and especially Hamdi (Shady Khalaf), the cheerful Egyptian cafeteria guy, who keeps trying to loosen her up with his coffee and jokes. Monaliza who's been living in an emotional ice cube for a long time, gradually opens up to Hamdi's charm and little by little lets him into her closed world and start to learn the joy of living. When Hamdi finally manages to draw a smile on Monaliza's face, things start getting complicated; Hamdi's work permit is expiring and he'll soon become “illegal”. On the other hand, Monaliza's trick backfires and suddenly everyone in the neighbourhood think that she is officially engaged to Suhail. Being socially inexperienced, and not wanting to lose the battle with Afaf, Monaliza doesn't know what to do about that neither she tells Hamdi about it. Until one day, after a big fight with Nayfeh in the office, Hamdi impulsively decided to show up at Monaliza's neighbourhood to meet her sister and propose, only to hear that Monaliza is already “engaged” to the grocer, Suhail. Feeling shocked and betrayed, Hamdi decides to go back to Egypt immediately and Monaliza thinks she must have lost him forever. But when Rodaina realizes the heartbreak, being a dedicated lover, she encourages Monaliza to run after him and work things out. Monaliza's story overlaps with a bunch of other characters’ who surround her; the story of her sister Afaf and what brought her to become agoraphobic, and the story of Rodaina, who is still waiting for her husband who disappeared in Iraq several years ago, and the story of Nayfeh at the office and her inexcusable bitterness.\n\nParagraph 3: Following Will's arrival in Bel-Air, he was a great distance from home and was considered an outsider by many people in his Bel-Air neighborhood.

Prior to appearing in The Bill he had already played the high-profile role of nightclub owner, Don Watkins, in the soap opera Coronation Street. He also made appearances in a number of other TV shows, including the first series of Starting Out, Boon, Minder, Dear John, Farrington of the F.O., Dempsey and Makepeace, Z-Cars, Andy Capp, Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Blake's 7 and Casualty. His film credits included roles in Trial by Combat (1976), Britannia Hospital (1982), Don't Open till Christmas (1984) and Link (1986).\n\nLloyd was one of the most popular members of the television show, The Bill. In 1996, the show won the award for \"Best TV Drama\" at the National Television Awards and it was Lloyd who collected it on behalf of the cast and crew. His Welsh-born father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was himself a police officer who was killed in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. \n\nA chronic alcoholic, he played \"Tosh\" continuously from 1988 until he was sacked from The Bill in 1998 for his lack of punctuality and failing to learn his lines. Within days, he was admitted to a clinic in Burton upon Trent for detoxification and was administered Antabuse (Disulfiram), but then left the premises to drink alcohol. He returned to the clinic in an intoxicated state, retired to bed, fell asleep, then choked on his vomit. Lloyd died just one week after recording his last scenes for The Bill, and the character of Tosh was still appearing on screen for more than a month after Lloyd's death.\n\nHe had been so popular on The Bill that on 26 February 1992, within four years of joining the show, he was selected as special guest for the TV guest show This Is Your Life. \n\nHe was the brother of ITN reporter Terry Lloyd who was killed in the Iraq War in 2003.

During live performances, vocalist Kelly Jones has been known to utilise the two bars without vocals before the final chorus to reference the Motörhead song \"Ace of Spades\".

The club was a founder member of the Football League in 1888, and has, as of May 2023, competed in the top division for a record 120 seasons, having missed only four top-flight seasons (1930–31, 1951–52, 1952–53, and 1953–54). Everton is the club with the second-longest continuous presence in English top-flight football, and ranks third in the all-time points rankings. The club has won nine league titles, five FA Cups, one European Cup Winners' Cup and nine Charity Shields.\nFormed in 1878, Everton won their first League Championship during the 1890–91 season. After winning four more League championships and two FA Cups, the club experienced a post-Second World War lull until a revival in the 1960s. A period of sustained success came in the mid-1980s, when Everton won a further two League championships, one FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.\nThe club's supporters are colloquially known as \"Evertonians\" or \"Blues\". Everton's main rivals are Liverpool, whose home stadium at Anfield is just under one mile away from Everton's home at Goodison Park; the two clubs contest the Merseyside derby. Everton have been based at Goodison Park since 1892, having moved from their original home at Anfield following a disagreement over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.\n\nHistory\nEverton was founded as St. Domingo's FC in 1878 so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, Everton, could play sport year round – cricket was played in summer. The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club. The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.The club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888–89 and won its first League Championship title in the 1890–91 season. Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again in 1914–15. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were reigning champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.\nIt was not until 1927 that Everton's first sustained period of success began. In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean from Tranmere Rovers. In 1927–28, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win its third League Championship that season. However, Everton was relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and was promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in 1931–32, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming its status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity. Everton also won its second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3–0 win against Manchester City in the final. The era ended in 1938–39 with a fifth League Championship.The outbreak of the Second World War again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Everton was relegated for the second time in 1950–51 and did not earn promotion until 1953–54, when it finished as the runner-up in its third season in the Second Division. The club has been a top-flight presence ever since.\nEverton's second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961. In 1962–63, his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship. In 1966 the club won the FA Cup with a 3–2 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Everton again reached the final in 1968, but this time was unable to overcome West Bromwich Albion at Wembley. Two seasons later in 1969–70, Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals Leeds United. During this period, Everton was the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions – covering the seasons from 1961–62 to 1966–67.However, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors", "acc_len": 2.478802992518703}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>DOD’s MILCON appropriations are used to fund the acquisition, construction, installation, and equipping of temporary or permanent public works, military installations, facilities, and real property needed to support U.S. military forces in the United States and overseas. As with other DOD activities, no funds may be appropriated in any fiscal year or obligated or expended for MILCON activities unless such funds have been specifically authorized by law. Each year, the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes amounts to be appropriated in each of the 18 programmatic MILCON appropriations accounts. Individual or conference committee reports accompanying each fiscal year’s National Defense Authorization Act provide specific congressional direction on authorized funding levels designated for specific construction projects supported by the various MILCON accounts. Similarly, conference committee reports or explanatory statements accompanying each fiscal year’s appropriations acts establish appropriated funding levels for MILCON projects. The process through which the active component requests funding for construction projects is supported by DOD’s Form 1391 Military Construction Project Data (Form 1391). The Form 1391 is to be used to support each project proposed for inclusion in the MILCON appropriations request submitted concurrently with all other DOD appropriations requests annually. The forms are to be used for both new projects as well as urgent unforeseen projects. The Form 1391 describes the scope, total project costs, and estimates of specific project elements. Costs associated with other project elements such as contingency and supervision, inspection, and design are also to be captured and included in the total requested amount. Finally, the Form 1391 is to include a description of the proposed construction and a requirements statement indicating what requirement the project provides. Project budget estimates are initially developed at the installation level and are provided to the next responsible level for review, validation, refinement, prioritization, and approval. Administrative support is to be provided when requested across the departments, but ultimately the installation is the originator and the primary responsible entity in developing the completed Form 1391. MILCON appropriations are generally available for obligation for 5 fiscal years, at which time the appropriation expires. For 5 years after they expire, appropriations are available for limited purposes, such as liquidating obligations made during the period of availability or adjusting contract costs. After these 5 years, any remaining unexpended amounts, whether obligated or unobligated, are canceled and returned to the U.S. Treasury. Once funds are returned to the U.S. Treasury, they are no longer available for any purposes. DOD obligates its appropriations throughout the period in which the appropriation is available. An “unobligated balance” is the difference between the total appropriation amount and total obligations made against the appropriated amounts. An “unexpended balance” is the total of obligated but unliquidated and unobligated amounts. According to DOD officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either rescinded by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. Reprogrammed amounts may be used to fund other projects where there are shortfalls; for projects authorized by Congress but not specifically funded through the appropriations process; for emergency projects, such as for facilities destroyed by fires. DOD’s flexibility to reprogram without congressional approval is limited by the amount to be reprogrammed to a particular project. DOD’s Financial Management Regulation requires prior congressional approval for a reprogramming that would result in an increase exceeding 25 percent of a project’s authorized base amount or $2 million, whichever is less. Prior approval is not required when established costs or project-related thresholds are not reached. According to DOD officials, reprogrammings requiring congressional approval are called “above-threshold reprogrammings” and those that do not are called “below-threshold reprogrammings.” DOD designates construction agents for the military departments and defense agencies with primary responsibility for developing and refining MILCON proposals and cost estimates, and to manage the design and construction of projects. Typically, the Army Corps of Engineers is the construction agent for Army MILCON-funded projects and the Naval Facilities Engineering Command is the construction agent for Navy and Marine Corps MILCON-funded projects. Either of those DOD entities can be the construction agent for the defense agencies and activities, such as for the Missile Defense Agency or Defense Education Activity, with the approval of the military department having jurisdiction of the real property facility. However, both the Army and the Navy may use each other’s construction agent if it is in the interest of efficiency and cost- effectiveness or when otherwise considered appropriate. The Air Force may use either the Army Corps of Engineers or Naval Facilities Engineering Command for its projects. Additionally, the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, although not a designated construction agent, reviews and approves requirements for Air Force MILCON cost estimates, and in some cases may design and construct Air Force projects where both the Air Force and the commander of the assigned construction agent agree that it is the most efficient, expeditious, and cost-effective means to complete the project.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nLanguage modelling in its inception had one-hot vector encoding of words. However, it captures only alphabetic ordering but not the word semantic similarity. Vector space models helps to learn word representations in a lower dimensional space and also captures semantic similarity. Learning word embedding aids in natural language processing tasks such as question answering and reasoning BIBREF0, stance detection BIBREF1, claim verification BIBREF2.\nRecent models BIBREF3, BIBREF4 work on the basis that words with similar context share semantic similarity. BIBREF4 proposes a neural probabilistic model which models the target word probability conditioned on the previous words using a recurrent neural network. Word2Vec models BIBREF3 such as continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) predict the target word given the context, and skip-gram model works in reverse of predicting the context given the target word. While, GloVe embeddings were based on a Global matrix factorization on local contexts BIBREF5. However, the aforementioned models do not handle words with multiple meanings (polysemies).\nBIBREF6 proposes a neural network approach considering both local and global contexts in learning word embeddings (point estimates). Their multiple prototype model handles polysemous words by providing apriori heuristics about word senses in the dataset. BIBREF7 proposes an alternative to handle polysemous words by a modified skip-gram model and EM algorithm. BIBREF8 presents a non-parametric based alternative to handle polysemies. However, these approaches fail to consider entailment relations among the words. BIBREF9 learn a Gaussian distribution per word using the expected likelihood kernel. However, for polysemous words, this may lead to word distributions with larger variances as it may have to cover various senses.\nBIBREF10 proposes multimodal word distribution approach. It captures polysemy. However, the energy based objective function fails to consider asymmetry and hence entailment. Textual entailment recognition is necessary to capture lexical inference relations such as causality (for example, mosquito $\\rightarrow $ malaria), hypernymy (for example, dog $\\models $ animal) etc.\nIn this paper, we propose to obtain multi-sense word embedding distributions by using a variant of max margin objective based on the asymmetric KL divergence energy function to capture textual entailment. Multi-sense distributions are advantageous in capturing polysemous nature of words and in reducing the uncertainty per word by distributing it across senses. However, computing KL divergence between mixtures of Gaussians is intractable, and we use a KL divergence approximation based on stricter upper and lower bounds. While capturing textual entailment (asymmetry), we have also not compromised on capturing symmetrical similarity between words (for example, funny and hilarious) which will be elucidated in Section $3.1$. We also show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the benchmark word similarity and entailment datasets in the experimental section.\nMethodology ::: Word Representation\nProbabilistic representation of words helps one model uncertainty in word representation, and polysemy. Given a corpus $V$, containing a list of words each represented as $w$, the probability density for a word $w$ can be represented as a mixture of Gaussians with $C$ components BIBREF10.\nHere, $p_{w,j}$ represents the probability of word $w$ belonging to the component $j$, $\\operatorname{\\mathbf {\\mu }}_{w,j}$ represents $D$ dimensional word representation corresponding to the $j^{th}$ component sense of the word $w$, and $\\Sigma _{w,j}$ represents the uncertainty in representation for word $w$ belonging to component $j$.\nObjective function\nThe model parameters (means, covariances and mixture weights) $\\theta $ can be learnt using a variant of max-margin objective BIBREF11.\nHere $E_\\theta (\\cdot , \\cdot )$ represents an energy function which assigns a score to the pair of words, $w$ is a particular word under consideration, $c$ its positive context (same context), and $c^{\\prime }$ the negative context. The objective aims to push the margin of the difference between the energy function of a word $w$ to its positive context $c$ higher than its negative context $c$ by a threshold of $m$. Thus, word pairs in the same context gets a higher energy than the word pairs in the dissimilar context. BIBREF10 consider the energy function to be an expected likelihood kernel which is defined as follows.\nThis is similar to the cosine similarity metric over vectors and the energy between two words is maximum when they have similar distributions. But, the expected likelihood kernel is a symmetric metric which will not be suitable for capturing ordering among words and hence entailment.\nObjective function ::: Proposed Energy function\nAs each word is represented by a mixture of Gaussian distributions, KL divergence is a better choice of energy function to capture distance between distributions. Since, KL divergence is minimum when the distributions are similar and maximum when they are dissimilar, energy function is taken as exponentiated negative KL divergence.\nHowever,", "acc_len": 2.491271820448878}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage:\nVictory in Europe Day\nVictory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. \n\nCelebrations \n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. \n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\" Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. \n\nMassive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. \n\nSoviet Victory Day \n\nAs the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a \"preliminary\" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\nCommemorative public holidays \n\n(May 8 unless otherwise stated)\n* Italy (25 April) \"Festa della Liberazione\" (Liberation Holiday).\n* Denmark (5 May) as \"Befrielsen\" (The Liberation)\n* Netherlands (5 May) as \"Bevrijdingsdag\" (Liberation Day)\n* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.\n*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nBetty Hall\nBeatrice Perin Barker Hall (March 18, 1921 – April 26, 2018) was an American politician from the state of New Hampshire. Hall served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives for a total of 28 years, serving non-consecutively from 1970 until 2008.\nHall grew up in New York City, where she attended Barnard College. In 1948, she and her husband moved to the town of Brookline, New Hampshire, where they started a textile manufacturing firm. Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, Hall began participating in local politics, serving on several boards and commissions in Brookline. Hall was elected to the Brookline school board in 1963, and in 1972, she was elected to the town board of selectmen.\nHall's career in statewide politics began in 1970 when she was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. In 1986, Hall switched her party affiliation to the Democratic Party, citing the Republican Party's shift towards conservatism during the Reagan Era. During her political career, Hall was described as a firebrand who frequently bucked her party. While a Republican, Hall was seen as a liberal member of that party, and was considered to be a political enemy by conservative leaders. In the Democratic Party, Hall was a member of the grassroots base, challenging the party's establishment in a 2007 campaign for chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.\nIn the 2000s, Hall became nationally known for her activism. In 2004, she was arrested for disorderly conduct for her participation in a protest against President George W. Bush; she was later acquitted of the charge. In 2008, Hall introduced New Hampshire House Resolution 24, which would have petitioned the United States Congress to introduce articles to impeach President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their actions leading to and during the Iraq War. While the bill ultimately failed, it generated a large amount of media coverage.\n\nPre-political life and career\nEarly life and education\nBeatrice Perin Barker was born on March 18, 1921, in Koblenz, Germany, where her father Joseph Warren Barker, a United States Army officer, served as the administrator of a military district following World War I. After leaving the military, Barker's father completed his education in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving an academic position at the institution. He later became the Dean of Engineering at Columbia University, and she primarily grew up in New York City. This led to Barker's entry into academia, as her father's position at Columbia University brought prominent scientists such as Enrico Fermi and Harold Urey to their home for dinner where Barker would serve as a hostess. In 1937, her mother Mary died when Barker was 16.Barker attended the Horace Mann School and later studied engineering at Barnard College. Barker would later do graduate work at the University of New Hampshire, Boston University, and the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nFamily and career\nAfter graduating from Barnard College in 1943, Barker worked as an engineer at Western Electric. During World War II, she helped manufacture vacuum tubes for radar equipment, and her father served as a special assistant to Frank Knox, the United States Secretary of the Navy.On May 27, 1944, she married Sidney Leavitt Hall, an engineer from Concord, New Hampshire, leaving her job at Western Electric to join her husband in Ohio, where he was undergoing training with the United States Air Force in order to fight in World War II. However, the war ended before he was sent overseas, and in 1948, the couple moved to Brookline, New Hampshire, a town of 800 people in Hillsborough County. Hall's grandmother, Florence Hobart Perin, was a resident of Brookline, and Hall had frequently visited and spent several summers in the town during her youth. Sidney Hall initially worked at Textron, and in 1951, the couple started a textile manufacturing firm called Hall Manufacturing Company, which was informally known as Hall Tote Bags. The company produced stitching for dry-cleaners, as well as steam air covers for dry-cleaning machines. Later, the company became locally famous for the tote bags they produced, as well as other stitched products. Hall and her husband were members of the local Church of Christ, and she was credited with uniting the Brookline Methodist and Congregationalist churches into one single church.In 1957, Hall received a fellowship from the National Science Foundation. Hall served as the assistant manager for Hall Manufacturing Co. until 1962, whereupon she became a science and mathematics teacher in Groton, Massachusetts. Hall transferred to Fairgrounds Junior High School in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1964, and taught mathematics there until 1972. In 1968, Hall was awarded a", "acc_len": 2.506234413965087}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Paragraph 1: The Lake Causeway (Calzada del Lago in Spanish) runs north from the lake shore to the city centre, where it continues as Via 5. The total length of the causeway and the via is around . The Lake Causeway was designed to allow the rapid movement of goods and people between the city and the lake, and easy access to water. The Lake Causeway probably developed from a Middle Preclassic pathway that ran between the shore and the early settlement. The earliest version of the Lake Causeway was built in the Late Preclassic; it was about  wide and was raised  above natural ground level. The Via 5 continuation did not exist in the Late Preclassic, when the later city centre had not yet developed. During the Late Classic the causeway was further developed and extended with the formal construction of Via 5 running across the site core. The point where the two met was deliberately narrowed with the construction of flanking buildings and is likely to have been a guardpost where access to the site core was controlled. It is likely that travellers and goods arriving at the city were inspected and taxed at this control point. At its narrowest point the entrance from the causeway to Via 5 was just  wide. Parapets were erected flanking the Lake Causeway; they stood approximately  high and varied from  wide. The southern extreme of the causeway was modified with the construction of a stucco-covered platform with masonry walls defining the east and south sides. From the southern end of the causeway to the union with Via 5 there is an approximate difference in altitude of more than . There is some evidence that steps were carved from the limestone bedrock where the southern platform met the Lake Causeway. During a second phase of construction in the Late Classic, the southern platform was enlarged to measure  east-west by  north-south. The platform was supported on the south and east sides by refurbished talud walls coated in stucco. The causeway itself was redesigned as a long ramp that joined the southern platform with the city centre and the junction with Via 5. In the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) the southern end of the Lake Causeway was re-dressed with limestone fill. The stepped sides of the southern platform were filled in and covered with stone to form ramps. At about this time Stela A, a plain monument, was erected on the platform. Also in the Terminal Classic the restrictions at the north end of the causeway where it met Via 5 were removed; the whole area was levelled with finely dressed stone and mortar that left the access free for the entire width of the causeway. Ceramic remains recovered from the Lake Causeway are scarce and poorly preserved due to the strong waterflow along the incline caused during the rain season, resulting in artefacts being eroded and washed downhill towards the lake.\n\nParagraph 2: Mordashov is the son of Russian parents, who were both steel mill workers. According to Mordashov, his family used welfare coupons, allowed only 200g of butter and 400g of sausages per month. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Leningrad Engineering-Economical Institute, currently known as ENGECON. He later gained an MBA from Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 2001. In an address to students at the European University at Saint Petersburg, Mordashov spoke about his decision to study in Leningrad rather than Moscow and the value his undergraduate studies played in his search for employment and eventual career path. Returning to Cherepovets, he started his career by joining the same steel plant where his parents had worked.\n\nParagraph 3: Vivie Warren, a thoroughly modern young woman, has just graduated from the University of Cambridge with honours in Mathematics (equal Third Wrangler), and is available for suitors. Her mother, Mrs. Warren (her name changed to hide her identity and give the impression that she is married), arranges for her to meet her friend Mr. Praed, a middle-aged, handsome architect, at the home where Vivie is staying. Mrs. Warren arrives with her business partner, Sir George Crofts, who is attracted to Vivie despite their 25-year age difference. Vivie is romantically involved with the youthful Frank Gardner, who sees her as his meal ticket. His father, the (married) Reverend Samuel Gardner, has a history with Vivie's mother. As we discover later, he may be Vivie's out-of-wedlock father, which would make Vivie and Frank half-siblings. Mrs. Warren successfully justifies to her daughter how she chose her particular profession in order to support her daughter and give her the opportunities she never had.

It was there when the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, was fought, and remained until December 1, when it rejoined the Army of the Potomac, and passed the winter of 1864 and 1865 in doing siege duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg, Va. The Regiment was engaged in all the skirmishes that took place during this period, the most important of which were Hatcher's Run, December 10, 1864; Hatcher's Run, February 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, 1865; Fort Fisher, Va., March 25, and Fort Stedman, same day. In the attack on Petersburg, April 2, 1865, the Regiment took a prominent and important part.  The night before, the 6th Corps was massed in front of Fort Fisher, ready for the assault.  Just at daybreak, Sunday morning, the lines advanced under a heavy fire, and carried the enemy's main lines by storm.  The Second Rhode Island started in the second line, but were the first to reach the works, and planted its colors on the parapet.  The enemy fled in great confusion, after their lines were pierced.  Lieutenant Frank S. Halliday, acting Adjutant of the Regiment, with a small party, carried a rebel fort mounting two guns, and turned them upon the enemy.  The whole affair was a glorious success, and caused the evacuation of the city on Monday morning, April 3. In the Battle of Sailors' Creek, Thursday following the above, April 6, the Regiment displayed great prowess.  About 5 o'clock, P. M., the division to which it was attached, advanced on the enemy's lines, and the Second Rhode Island attacked a part of the Naval Brigade, commanded by officers of the late rebel fleet.  The Regiment charged to within a few feet of their lines, when it met a severe flank fire, which forced it to retire.  The action as so close that men were bayoneted, and knocked down with the butts of muskets.  In the confusion, the colors of the Regiment were captured, but were quickly retaken.  The place where it charged was swampy, with water at least three feet deep, but the men pushed gallantly forward, and regained all the ground lost, causing the enemy to flee in great confusion, who left a part of their wagons in Federal hands.  The loss was severe in officers and men, but there was a proud satisfaction in knowing that the efforts of the Regiment hastened the surrender of Lee and his army. Captain Charles W. Gleason and Lieutenant William H. Perry, both gallant officers, were killed.  They were loved and respected by the Regiment. They entered the service as enlisted men at the beginning of the war, and by merit rose to their positions as officers.  In this battle the conduct of officers and men was in the highest degree commendable.

In August 1915, he moved to the special group in Warsaw. Soon he became an aide-de-camp to Józef Piłsudski. In 1918, he was sent on a mission to Russia. He was given three tasks: persuade General Józef Haller's army, then in the Ukraine, to back Piłsudski (he failed in this task); reach the French military mission in Moscow under General Lavergne (he succeeded in this task); and return from Moscow to Paris to liaise with the government there. Unfortunately, he was arrested by the Soviet Cheka as a member of the Polish Military Organisation while on a French diplomatic train on its way from Moscow to Murmansk (and Paris). He was imprisoned in the Taganka prison. He was freed thanks to the intervention of his future wife, Bronisława Wieniawa-Długoszowska, with the much-feared Cheka operative Yakovleva, then in charge of the prison. Bronisława, née Kliatchkin, was at that time married to the lawyer , the lawyer of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the head of the Cheka.

Olaf, who became king of Norway, gave land to Ketel and arranged a good marriage for him; according to the 13th-century saga-writer Snorri Sturluson, \"from him are descended many great people\".  Skule became known as Skule Kongsfostre (king's foster-son), and was remembered as a remarkably intelligent and handsome man who commanded the king's hird.  He married a relative of the king, Gudrun Nevsteinsdotter, and their son was Åsolv of Rein (in Rissa), father of the lendmann Guttorm of Rein.  Guttorm's son, Bård Guttormsson of Rein, was a close friend and supporter of king Sverre Sigurdsson, fought alongside him in several battles, and was rewarded by being given the king's half-sister, Cecilia Sigurdsdotter, in marriage.  Bård and Cecilia's son Inge Bårdsson was born about the year 1185.  In 1204, when the child-king Guttorm Sigurdsson died, the two obvious candidates for the crown were Inge and his half-brother Haakon Galen, Cecilia's son by another husband.  After a struggle for power Inge was recognized as king, while Haakon retained his former command of the army.  This did not produce peace, for a faction known as the Bagler succeeded in splitting the kingdom, with Inge ruling the western half and their own candidate, Philip Simonsson, the eastern half.  Moreover, earl Haakon renewed his own claim to the crown, a claim which only lapsed with his death in 1214.  King Inge himself died in 1217.  Since 1213 the leader of the army and the hird had been Inge's half-brother Skule, a son of Bård Guttormsson by another wife, Ragnfrid Erlingsdotter, and therefore, like king Inge, fifth in descent in the male line from Tostig", "acc_len": 2.516209476309227}
