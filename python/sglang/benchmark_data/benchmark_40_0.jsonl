Johnson, St. Paul's Church-Yard.\n\nMDCCLXXXVIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\n\nIn delineating the Heroine of this Fiction, the Author attempts to\ndevelop a character different from those generally portrayed. This woman\nis neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It would be vain\nto mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to\nremark, how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the\noriginals of great masters. They catch the gross parts; but the subtile\nspirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation disgusts,\nwhen grace was expected to charm.\n\nThose compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing\ncaptives, where the soul of the author is exhibited, and animates the\nhidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm, they live in the scenes\nthey represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track,\nsolicitous to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath,\naccording to the prescribed rules of art.\n\nThese chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an\necho--even of the sweetest sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime\nbeams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be of their own creating--or\nthe prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying\nprinciple, fades and dies.\n\nIn an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has\nthinking powers is displayed. The female organs have been thought too\nweak for this arduous employment; and experience seems to justify the\nassertion. Without arguing physically about _possibilities_--in a\nfiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived\nfrom the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but\ndrawn by the individual from the original source.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: Rousseau.]\n\n[Footnote B: I here give the Reviewers an opportunity of being very\nwitty about the Paradise of Fools, &c.]\n\n\n\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. I.\n\n\nMary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who\nmarried Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in\nher temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues,\nindeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the _shews_ of\nthings, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as\nthe generality approved of. She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and\nthe years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments,\nwithout having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into\nthe polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished\nto be united to; but her father soon after recommending another in a\nmore distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted to his will, and\npromised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.\n\nWhile they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style,\nand seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they\nwooed rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful\ncountry, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;\nfor the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved,\nand sought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and\nafter eating an immoderate dinner, generally fell asleep: this\nseasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then\nvisit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow\nof health with his wife's countenance, which even rouge could not\nenliven, it is not necessary to say which a _gourmand_ would give the\npreference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more\nagreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was\nbut the shadow of a sound, and she had, to complete her delicacy, so", "acc_len": 1.7611408199643495}

I won’t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.", "acc_len": 1.856046065259117}

How Otto Saw the Great Emperor,\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD.\n\nBetween the far away past history of the world, and that which lies near\nto us; in the time when the wisdom of the ancient times was dead and\nhad passed away, and our own days of light had not yet come, there lay a\ngreat black gulf in human history, a gulf of ignorance, of superstition,\nof cruelty, and of wickedness.\n\nThat time we call the dark or middle ages.\n\nFew records remain to us of that dreadful period in our world's history,\nand we only know of it through broken and disjointed fragments that have\nbeen handed down to us through the generations.\n\nYet, though the world's life then was so wicked and black, there yet\nremained a few good men and women here and there (mostly in peaceful\nand quiet monasteries, far from the thunder and the glare of the worlds\nbloody battle), who knew the right and the truth and lived according to\nwhat they knew; who preserved and tenderly cared for the truths that the\ndear Christ taught, and lived and died for in Palestine so long ago.\n\nThis tale that I am about to tell is of a little boy who lived and\nsuffered in those dark middle ages; of how he saw both the good and the\nbad of men, and of how, by gentleness and love and not by strife and\nhatred, he came at last to stand above other men and to be looked up to\nby all. And should you follow the story to the end, I hope you may find\nit a pleasure, as I have done, to ramble through those dark ancient\ncastles, to lie with little Otto and Brother John in the high\nbelfry-tower, or to sit with them in the peaceful quiet of the sunny\nold monastery garden, for, of all the story, I love best those early\npeaceful years that little Otto spent in the dear old White Cross on the\nHill.\n\nPoor little Otto's life was a stony and a thorny pathway, and it is well\nfor all of us nowadays that we walk it in fancy and not in truth.\n\n\n\n\nI. The Dragon's House.\n\nUp from the gray rocks, rising sheer and bold and bare, stood the walls\nand towers of Castle Drachenhausen. A great gate-way, with a heavy\niron-pointed portcullis hanging suspended in the dim arch above, yawned\nblackly upon the bascule or falling drawbridge that spanned a chasm\nbetween the blank stone walls and the roadway that winding down the\nsteep rocky slope to the little valley just beneath. There in the lap of\nthe hills around stood the wretched straw-thatched huts of the peasants\nbelonging to the castle--miserable serfs who, half timid, half fierce,\ntilled their poor patches of ground, wrenching from the hard soil barely\nenough to keep body and soul together. Among those vile hovels played\nthe little children like foxes about their dens, their wild, fierce eyes\npeering out from under a mat of tangled yellow hair.\n\nBeyond these squalid huts lay the rushing, foaming river, spanned by a\nhigh, rude, stone bridge where the road from the castle crossed it, and\nbeyond the river stretched the great, black forest, within whose gloomy\ndepths the savage wild beasts made their lair, and where in winter time\nthe howling wolves coursed their flying prey across the moonlit snow and\nunder the net-work of the black shadows from the naked boughs above.\n\nThe watchman in the cold, windy bartizan or watch-tower that clung to\nthe gray walls above the castle gateway, looked from his narrow window,\nwhere the wind piped and hummed, across the tree-tops that rolled in\nendless billows of green, over hill and over valley to the blue and\ndistant slope of the Keiserberg, where, on the mountain side, glimmered\nfar away the walls of", "acc_len": 1.90978886756238}

Rye or wheat, oats, peas, beets, cabbage, pork products, and potatoes are the staples.

Tina is angry when she finds out, but forgives Tosh and supports her when she discovers she is not pregnant again. They fall out when Tosh accuses her of not wanting a baby, and Tosh punches her after taunting her. Tina again forgives her and decides to try and reconcile Tosh with her family by arranging a lunch for them. Her mother Judy (Jo Martin) comes, but her father makes an excuse, uncomfortable with Tosh's sexuality due to his Christian faith. Judy storms out when Tina tells her about their attempts to have a baby, upsetting Tosh further. Tina is devastated when Stan reveals that he is dying from prostate cancer, and is even more upset when she learns that Stan knew about his illness 3 years prior to him telling the family. She and Tosh urge Stan to see a private doctor, however he reveals that Stan's cancer is too aggressive to be cured, which leaves Tina distraught. Tina supports Sonia when she falls ill, and she confides in her that she spent the money from the charity calendar she organised on a gastric band in Bulgaria, to impress her husband Martin (James Bye).

From an early age, he showed himself to be a reckless romantic – while still a child, he stole some jewels and attempted to take ship to Holland, presumably to join the army. When he was thirteen, the First Bishops' War broke out, and the young nobleman sneaked out of Gordon Castle (one account says he climbed over the wall) and hurried to the Highlands, where he raised a brigade of clansmen from his father's estates to fight the Covenanters. His first experience of war was at Megray Hill, where his Highlanders scattered in the face of enemy cannon fire.\nFollowing the peace, Lord Lewis travelled to France, where he enlisted as an ordinary pikeman in an infantry regiment, in order to learn his soldiering from the ground up. After three years, he traveled to England, working his way north by serving on both sides in the English Civil War, first in the royalist army and then in the Scottish Covenanter forces of his uncle, the Earl of Argyll, the same army he had fought against in 1639.\nEventually returning home, the sixteen-year-old nobleman seduced and married the fiancée of his absent elder brother, Viscount Aboyne. He served on both sides in the Scottish Civil War, playing an important role in his father's occupation of Aberdeen in 1646, where he engaged an enemy cavalry commander in single combat and then storming the town. Going into exile after the defeat of the royalists, he traveled again to France; in rapid succession, he succeeded his brother and father as Earl of Enzie and Marquess of Gordon, and by 1651, he was allowed to return to Scotland, even though he refused to conform to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (he was probably a Roman Catholic).\nIn 1645 Lord Lewis attacked Brodie Castle in Moray and setting it afire destroyed important archives and documents detailing the origins of the illustrious Clan Brodie. This despicable act secured Clan Brodie's place among the great mysteries of Scotland.\nHe died aged 26 or 27, leaving a young widow (whom he had apparently converted to Catholicism), three daughters, and a four-year-old son who would eventually become the 1st Duke of Gordon. Miles Gourdon, a cavalry commander in the French army known as the chevalier or count of \"Crolis\", was perhaps an illegitimate son, as he is said to have been a brother of the duke.His reputation among historians has varied; he is the clearest hero in the Civil War narrative of his kinsman Patrick Gordon of Ruthven, while John Buchan regarded him as wild and headstrong to the point of insanity.\nPassage 3:\nChristopher Lambert (MP)\nChristopher Lambert, of Winchester, Hampshire, was an English politician.\nHe was the second son of William Lambert of Winchester and a servant of Sir William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester.\nLambert was a Member of Parliament for Bridport in 1593.\nPassage 4:\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester\nWilliam Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester  (c. 1532 – 24 November 1598) was an English nobleman, the son of John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester and his first wife, Elizabeth Willoughby.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Introduction\nMulti-document summarization (MDS), the transformation of a set of documents into a short text containing their most important aspects, is a long-studied problem in NLP. Generated summaries have been shown to support humans dealing with large document collections in information seeking tasks BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . However, when exploring a set of documents manually, humans rarely write a fully-formulated summary for themselves. Instead, user studies BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 show that they note down important keywords and phrases, try to identify relationships between them and organize them accordingly. Therefore, we believe that the study of summarization with similarly structured outputs is an important extension of the traditional task.\nA representation that is more in line with observed user behavior is a concept map BIBREF5 , a labeled graph showing concepts as nodes and relationships between them as edges (Figure FIGREF2 ). Introduced in 1972 as a teaching tool BIBREF6 , concept maps have found many applications in education BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , for writing assistance BIBREF9 or to structure information repositories BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . For summarization, concept maps make it possible to represent a summary concisely and clearly reveal relationships. Moreover, we see a second interesting use case that goes beyond the capabilities of textual summaries: When concepts and relations are linked to corresponding locations in the documents they have been extracted from, the graph can be used to navigate in a document collection, similar to a table of contents. An implementation of this idea has been recently described by BIBREF12 .\nThe corresponding task that we propose is concept-map-based MDS, the summarization of a document cluster in the form of a concept map. In order to develop and evaluate methods for the task, gold-standard corpora are necessary, but no suitable corpus is available. The manual creation of such a dataset is very time-consuming, as the annotation includes many subtasks. In particular, an annotator would need to manually identify all concepts in the documents, while only a few of them will eventually end up in the summary.\nTo overcome these issues, we present a corpus creation method that effectively combines automatic preprocessing, scalable crowdsourcing and high-quality expert annotations. Using it, we can avoid the high effort for single annotators, allowing us to scale to document clusters that are 15 times larger than in traditional summarization corpora. We created a new corpus of 30 topics, each with around 40 source documents on educational topics and a summarizing concept map that is the consensus of many crowdworkers (see Figure FIGREF3 ).\nAs a crucial step of the corpus creation, we developed a new crowdsourcing scheme called low-context importance annotation. In contrast to traditional approaches, it allows us to determine important elements in a document cluster without requiring annotators to read all documents, making it feasible to crowdsource the task and overcome quality issues observed in previous work BIBREF13 . We show that the approach creates reliable data for our focused summarization scenario and, when tested on traditional summarization corpora, creates annotations that are similar to those obtained by earlier efforts.\nTo summarize, we make the following contributions: (1) We propose a novel task, concept-map-based MDS (§ SECREF2 ), (2) present a new crowdsourcing scheme to create reference summaries (§ SECREF4 ), (3) publish a new dataset for the proposed task (§ SECREF5 ) and (4) provide an evaluation protocol and baseline (§ SECREF7 ). We make these resources publicly available under a permissive license.\nTask\nConcept-map-based MDS is defined as follows: Given a set of related documents, create a concept map that represents its most important content, satisfies a specified size limit and is connected.\nWe define a concept map as a labeled graph showing concepts as nodes and relationships between them as edges. Labels are arbitrary sequences of tokens taken from the documents, making the summarization task extractive. A concept can be an entity, abstract idea, event or activity, designated by its unique label. Good maps should be propositionally coherent, meaning that every relation together with the two connected concepts form a meaningful proposition.\nThe task is complex, consisting of several interdependent subtasks. One has to extract appropriate labels for concepts and relations and recognize different expressions that refer to the same concept across multiple documents. Further, one has to select the most important concepts and relations for the summary and finally organize them in a graph satisfying the connectedness and size constraints.\nRelated Work\nSome attempts have been made to automatically construct concept maps from text, working with either single documents BIBREF14 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 or document clusters BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 .

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nBlack Death\nThe Black Death (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality or the Plague) was a bubonic plague pandemic occurring in Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1346 to 1353. It is the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, causing the deaths of 75–200 million people, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351. Bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis spread by fleas, but during the Black Death it probably also took a secondary form, spread by person-to-person contact via aerosols, causing pneumonic plague.The Black Death was the beginning of the second plague pandemic. The plague created religious, social and economic upheavals, with profound effects on the course of European history.\nThe origin of the Black Death is disputed. Genetic analysis points to the evolution of Yersinia pestis in the Tian Shan mountains on the border between Kyrgyzstan and China 2,600 years ago. The immediate territorial origins of the Black Death and its outbreak remains unclear with some pointing towards Central Asia, China, the Middle East and Europe. The pandemic was reportedly first introduced to Europe during the siege of the Genoese trading port of Kaffa in Crimea by the Golden Horde army of Jani Beg in 1347. From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, Western Asia and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily and the Italian Peninsula. There is evidence that once it came ashore, the Black Death mainly spread person-to-person as pneumonic plague, thus explaining the quick inland spread of the epidemic, which was faster than would be expected if the primary vector was rat fleas causing bubonic plague. In 2022, it was discovered that there was a sudden surge of deaths in what is today Kyrgyzstan from the Black Death in the late 1330s; when combined with genetic evidence, this implies that the initial spread may not have been due to Mongol conquests in the 14th century, as previously speculated.The Black Death was the second great natural disaster to strike Europe during the Late Middle Ages (the first one being the Great Famine of 1315–1317) and is estimated to have killed 30 percent to 60 percent of the European population, as well as about one-third of the population of the Middle East. The plague might have reduced the world population from c. 475 million to 350–375 million in the 14th century. There were further outbreaks throughout the Late Middle Ages and, with other contributing factors (the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages), the European population did not regain its level in 1300 until 1500. Outbreaks of the plague recurred around the world until the early 19th century.\n\nNames\nEuropean writers contemporary with the plague described the disease in Latin as pestis or pestilentia, 'pestilence'; epidemia, 'epidemic'; mortalitas, 'mortality'. In English prior to the 18th century, the event was called the \"pestilence\" or \"great pestilence\", \"the plague\" or the \"great death\". Subsequent to the pandemic \"the furste moreyn\" (first murrain) or \"first pestilence\" was applied, to distinguish the mid-14th century phenomenon from other infectious diseases and epidemics of plague.The 1347 pandemic plague was not referred to specifically as \"black\" in the time of occurrence in any European language, though the expression \"black death\" had occasionally been applied to fatal disease beforehand. \"Black death\" was not used to describe the plague pandemic in English until the 1750s; the term is first attested in 1755, where it translated Danish: den sorte død, lit. 'the black death'. This expression as a proper name for the pandemic had been popularized by Swedish and Danish chroniclers in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and in the 16th and 17th centuries was transferred to other languages as a calque: Icelandic: svarti dauði, German: der schwarze Tod, and French: la mort noire. Previously, most European languages had named the pandemic a variant or calque of the Latin: magna mortalitas, lit. 'Great Death'.The phrase 'black death' – describing Death as black – is very old. Homer used it in the Odyssey to describe the monstrous Scylla, with her mouths \"full of black Death\" (Ancient Greek: πλεῖοι μέλανος Θανάτοιο, romanized: pleîoi mélanos Thanátoio). Seneca the Younger may have been the first to describe an epidemic as 'black death', (Latin: mors atra) but only in reference to the acute lethality and dark prognosis of disease.

Being similar in stature to Awesome Kong Thompson began to wrestle wearing a black wrestling mask as well as growing his beard out as he wrestled as \"King Kong\", collectively King Kong and Awesome Kong were known as \"The Colossal Kongs\". In mid-1993 the Kongs worked for Big D Pro Wrestling (BDPW) as well as the Dallas, Texas-based Global Wrestling Federation (GWF). During their tenure in the GWF they were involved in a storyline against the then reigning GWF Tag Team Champion The Ebony Experience (Booker T and Stevie Ray), but never won the championship. In the same year, the team signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In WCW they were managed by Harley Race, the duo competed in WCW's tag team division. Their first real match on a national level took place as Clash of the Champions XXIV where the team lost to Sting and Ric Flair. Later on both of the Colossal Kong's competed in the 1993 Battlebowl tournament part of the WCW Pay Per View (PPV) of the same name. In the tournament King Kong teamed up with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Awesome Kong and The Equalizer, with the storyline being that the teams were \"randomly drawn\" to face off. Winning the match meant that King Kong was one of 20 wrestlers competing in a battle royal at the end of the night, won by Big Van Vader. King Kong would also work WCW's 1993 Starrcade show, losing to The Shockmaster in a singles match. The PPV loss was one of Thompson's last matches for WCW, after which he returned to the independent circuit in Texas. At this point he had tweaked his ring name outside of WCW to \"Krusher Kong\" instead of the more generic \"King Kong\". In Texas he held the NWA Brass Knuckles Championship for 73 days, until he lost it to Eclipse on August 14, 1998. He would later hold the Pro Wrestling Championship (PCW) title in 2001 as well as the Texas Championship Wrestling (later renamed Xtreme Championship Wrestling) singles title and the tag team titles twice in 2003.

Its apparent stylistic consistency is largely due to conscious efforts of architects over several centuries to echo each other's work and preserve a strong sense of historical continuity, mirroring that of the French monarchy and state; American essayist Adam Gopnik has written that \"The continuity the Louvre represents is the continuity of the French state.\" For example, from the 1620s to the 1650s Jacques Lemercier thoroughly replicated the Lescot Wing's patterns for his design of the northern half of the western wing of the Cour Carrée.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>The federal government supports the development of airport infrastructure in three different ways. First, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. Second, Congress has authorized airports to assess a local passenger facility charge (PFC) on each boarding passenger, subject to specific federal approval. PFC revenues can be used for a broader range of projects than AIP funds, including \"landside\" projects such as passenger terminals and ground access improvements. Third, federal law grants investors preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued by state and local governments for airport improvements (subject to compliance with federal rules). Airports may also draw on state and local funds and on operating revenues, such as lease payments and landing fees. A federal role in airport infrastructure first developed during World War II. Prior to the war, airports were a local or private responsibility, with federal support limited to the tax exclusion of municipal bond interest. National defense needs led to the first major federal support for airport construction. After the war, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-377) continued federal a id, although at lower levels than during the war years. Initially, much of this spending supported conversion of military airports to civilian use. In the 1960s, substantial funding also was used to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets. In 1970, Congress responded to increasing congestion, both in the air and on the ground at U.S. airports, by passing two laws. The first, the Airport and Airway Development Act, established the forerunner programs of AIP: the Airport Development Aid Program and the Planning Grant Program. The second, the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, dealt with the revenue side of airport development, establishing the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF, also referred to as the Aviation Trust Fund, and in this report, the trust fund). The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-248 ; the 1982 Act) created the current AIP and reactivated the trust fund. For a more detailed legislative history of AIP, see Appendix A of this report. Eight years later, amid concerns that the existing sources of funds for airport development would be insufficient to meet national airport needs, the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 (Title IX of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, P.L. 101-508 ) allowed the Secretary of Transportation to authorize public agencies that control commercial airports to impose a passenger facility charge on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at their airports. Different airports use different combinations of AIP funding, PFCs, tax-exempt bonds, state and local grants, and airport revenues to finance particular projects. Small airports are more likely to be dependent on AIP grants than large or medium-sized airports. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. Each of these funding sources places various legislative, regulatory, or contractual constraints on airports that use it. The availability and conditions of one source of funding may also influence the availability and terms of other funding sources. In a 2015 study, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that airport-generated net income financed about 38% of airports' capital spending, AIP 33%, PFCs 18%, capital contributions by airport sponsor (often a state or municipality) or by other sources such as an airline or tenant 6%, and state grants nearly 5%. AIP provides federal grants to airports for airport development and planning. Participants range from very large publicly owned commercial airports to small general aviation airports that may be privately owned but are available for public use. AIP funding is usually limited to construction of improvements related to aircraft operations, such as runways and taxiways. Commercial revenue-producing facilities are generally not eligible for AIP funding, nor are operating costs. The structure of AIP funds distribution reflects congressional priorities and the objectives of assuring airport safety and security, increasing airport capacity, reducing congestion, helping fund noise and environmental mitigation costs, and financing small state and community airports. The main financial advantage of AIP to airports is that, as a grant program, it can provide funds for capital projects without the financial burden of debt financing, although airports are required to provide a modest local match to the federal funds. Limitations on the use of AIP grants include the range of projects that AIP can fund and the requirement that recipients adhere to all program regulations and grant assurances. Federal law requires the Secretary of Transportation to publish a national plan for the development of public-use airports in the United States. This appears as a biannual Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publication called the National Plan of Integrated Airport System s (NPIAS) . For an airport to receive AIP funds, it must be listed in the NPIAS. A", "acc_len": 2.199546485260771}

Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge", "acc_len": 2.2108843537414966}

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage:\nFatted calf\nFatted calf is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the parable of the prodigal son in the New Testament.  In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal.  Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions.  Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father \"kills the fatted calf\" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\n\nIn modern usage, \"killing the fatted calf\" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\".\nQuestion:\n\"In the Bible, whose return heralded the killing of \"\"the fatted calf\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nLoving Father\nPassage:\nKingdom of the Algarve\nThe Kingdom of the Algarve (Portuguese: Reino do Algarve, from the Arabic Gharb al-Andalusغرب الأندلس), later the Kingdom of the Algarves (Portuguese: Reino dos Algarves), was a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nIt was the second dominion of the Portuguese Crown and supposedly a kingdom apart from Portugal, though in fact the Algarvian kingdom had no institutions, special privileges, or autonomy. \nIn actuality, it was just an honorific title for the Algarve based on its history and was very similar to the rest of the Portuguese provinces. \n\nThe title King of Silves was first used by Sancho I of Portugal after the first conquest of Silves in 1189. As this conquest did not take all of the Algarve, D. Sancho never used the title King of Portugal and the Algarve, but instead it was adopted by his grandson Afonso III of Portugal as a part of the titles and honours of the Portuguese Crown.\n\nHistory\n\nReconquista\n\nDuring the Reconquista, Portuguese and Castilian conquests went south, to take lands from the Muslims that they claimed as theirs. Portugal conquered and secured much of its southern borders during the reigns of King Sancho II of Portugal and King Afonso III of Portugal.\n\nFirst conquest\n\nIn 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered Silves, one of the most prosperous cities in Al-Andalus, aligned at the time with the Almohad Caliphate. Portuguese control over Silves would be short, with the Almohads conquering the city again in 1191 in a massive counter-attack led by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur the Almohad Caliph in person.\n\nThe conquest of Algarve\n\nWith the decline of the Almohads, the southern taifa city-states united under a single Emir, Mûsâ Ibn Muhammad Ibn Nassir Ibn Mahfûz, former governor of Niebla, and known among the Christians as Aben Mafom.\n\nAben Mafom, King of Niebla and Emir of Algarve, trying to counter the achievements made by the Portuguese in their territories, declared vassalage to Alfonso X of Castile (who thus titled himself the King of the Algarve). Through his vassals, Alfonso X hoped to claim dominion over the Algarve not yet conquered by the Portuguese. \n\nThe Emir's vow of vassalage to Castille however did not stop the knights of the Order of Santiago, under the command of the Grand-Master Paio Peres Correia, from conquering most of the region city by city, between 1242 and 1249, including Silves. In March 1249, King Afonso III of Portugal captured Faro, the last Muslim stronghold in Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista.\n\nThe entitlement of Afonso III of Portugal as King of Portugal and the Algarve would serve as a reaction to Alfonso X of Castile's claim to the Algarve and was designed to demonstrate the rights of the Portuguese monarch on the region concerned.\n\nThe issue between the sovereigns of Castille and Portugal was eventually settled by the Treaty of Badajoz (1267), where King Alfonso X gave up his claims of the Algarve, making his grandson Dinis the heir to the throne of the Algarve, which dictated the terms of its incorporation into the Portuguese crown. The treaty, though, allowed the use of the title of King of the Algarve for King Alfonso X and his descendants, since King Alfonso X had acquired the territories of Al-Gharb Al-Andalus on the other side of the Guadiana river. The kings of Castile, and then Spain, would add the title to their repertoire of titles until the ascent of Queen Isabel II of Spain to the throne.\n\nAge of Discoveries\n\nDuring the Age of Discoveries, the Algarve", "acc_len": 2.2312925170068025}
{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Passage 1:\nRed Dragon (2002 film)\nRed Dragon is a 2002 psychological thriller film based on the 1981 novel by Thomas Harris. It was directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. It is the third film of the Dino De Laurentiis Company production, last produced by Universal and last starred by actor Anthony Hopkins. It follows The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Hannibal (2001) as a prequel, being followed by Hannibal Rising (2007). The film sees FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) enlisting the help of serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to catch another killer, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes). Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Philip Seymour Hoffman also star.\nIt is considered the fourth of the five released films regarding Hannibal Lecter. The novel was previously adapted into the film Manhunter (1986). Both films feature the same cinematographer, Dante Spinotti. After turning down the Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal (2001), Silence of the Lambs screenwriter Ted Tally returned to write Red Dragon. It was released on October 4, 2002 to generally positive reviews from critics, who deemed it to be an improvement over Hannibal, but inferior to The Silence of the Lambs.      It was a box office success, earning $209 million worldwide against a $78 million budget. An origin story, titled Hannibal Rising was released in 2007.\n\nPlot\nIn 1980, FBI agent Will Graham visits forensic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter to discuss a case. Graham has been working with Lecter on a psychological profile of a serial killer who removes edible body parts from his victims; Graham is certain the killer is a cannibal. Realizing Graham is close to discovering he is the killer, Lecter stabs him, but Graham subdues him before falling unconscious. Lecter is imprisoned in an institution for the criminally insane, and Graham, traumatized, retires to Florida with his family.\nYears later, in 1986, another serial killer nicknamed the Tooth Fairy has killed two families – the Jacobis and the Leeds – during full moons. With another full moon approaching, special agent Jack Crawford persuades Graham to help develop the killer's profile. After visiting the crime scenes in Atlanta, Georgia, and Birmingham, Alabama, and speaking with Crawford, Graham concludes that he must consult Lecter. Lecter taunts Graham but agrees to help.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy is Francis Dolarhyde, who kills as directed by his alternate personality, which he calls the Great Red Dragon, named after the William Blake painting The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun, which he has tattooed on his back. He believes that each victim brings him closer to becoming the Dragon, as his psychopathology originates from his childhood abuse by his grandmother.\nFreddy Lounds, a tabloid reporter for the National Tattler, pursues Graham for leads on the Tooth Fairy. A letter from the Tooth Fairy is discovered hidden in Lecter's cell, expressing admiration for Lecter and an interest in Graham and suggesting that Lecter reply through the personals section of the Tattler, which he does with Graham's home address, forcing Graham's wife, Molly, and son, Josh, to relocate. While in hiding, Graham teaches Molly how to fire a handgun.\nTo lure out the Tooth Fairy, Graham gives an interview to Lounds, disparaging the killer as an impotent homosexual and that Lecter was only feigning interest in him. Enraged, Dolarhyde kidnaps Lounds, glues him to a wheelchair and reveals himself as the Great Red Dragon. Dolarhyde shows Lounds photos he took of his victims before and after he murdered them. Dolarhyde forces Lounds to recant his allegations on tape, sets him on fire and sends him rolling and crashing into a company sign outside the Tattler offices.\nAt his job in a St. Louis photo lab, Dolarhyde gives blind co-worker Reba McClane a ride to her home and they begin a relationship. However, his alternate personality demands that he kill her. Desperate to stop the Dragon's control over him, Dolarhyde goes to the Brooklyn Museum, tears apart the Blake painting, and eats it.\nGraham realizes that the Tooth Fairy knew the layout of his victims' houses from their home videos. He deduces that he works for the company that edits the home movies and transfers them to video. He visits the company processing plant to ask for information, and is spotted by Dolarhyde as he returns from Brooklyn.\nIn a panic, Dolarhyde goes to Reba's house. She has spent the evening with a co-worker, Ralph Mandy. After Reba enters her home, Dolarhyde kills Ralph, kidnaps Reba, takes her to his house, and sets it ablaze.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>讲者1：见解。 然后也非常感谢我们四位嘉宾非常精彩的分享。 那么接下来我们就话不多说，倒入我们的圆桌讨论环节。 首先第一个话题，相信我们在座的各位嘉宾以及在场的观众都是比较有共鸣的一个话题，他就是年龄焦虑。 那么在一个理想化的老龄化社会中，其实衰老是非常自然而然的。 但是在现实中，年龄焦虑遍布公众舆论。 例如今年年仅 18 岁的谷爱凌，作为自由式滑雪项目中最年轻的奥运冠军，成为了媒体与商业的宠儿。 在职场中也有很多的工作设立了 35 岁门槛，这致使人们对于变老普遍带有不安的情绪。 然后也为我们建构一个积极的老龄化社会带来了一些阻碍。 那么请为各位嘉宾对于身处年龄焦虑的，众多年轻人和中年人有什么建议？ 然后对于是就社会现象又有什么解决的方案？ 那不如我们先从陆杰华教授开始。 我们很想知道您从一个社会角度，社会学的角度，您对年龄焦虑的看法是什么？\n讲者2：好谢谢主持人我觉得提了一个非常好的一个这个问题，因为每个人都会这个关注自身的这个年龄的增长。 那是年龄焦虑我觉得可能是对这个就是衰老的一个焦虑。 我觉得现在我们对所有的人不仅是今天的老年人，也是包括今天的这个中年人，青年人包括年轻人。 我们一定要告诉每个人，我们都在变老的路上，我们所做的这一切其实我们他都是有定数的。 那么我们要做好一定的一种我们这个准备。 不管是年轻人还是中年人。 我想的有一句话，就时间不一定能够造就有一个伟人，因为今天的年轻人这个都是互联网的时代，他们希望能够成为科学家，成为像谷爱凌那样的这个体育明星，成为政治家。 但是我们一定要记住，时间不一定造就一个伟人，但时间一定会成交一个老人的，我们每个人都会变老的，我们所做的一切不仅是关注今天的老人，也要关注。\n讲者2：当我们未来的老的时候，这个我们怎么去这个应对？ 所以我觉得在这样的一个这个状况下，我们怎么样构建一个这个不分年龄，人人共享的年龄友好型的这种社会和那理念是非常这个重要的。 这样的话我们才能够这个不仅是尊老爱老孝老，也能使年轻人呐这个在尊重生命的这个同时能够发挥自己的一个才智。 我就简单说这些。\n讲者1：非常感谢陆建华老师的分享。 其他嘉宾有想分享的吗？ 我听到李轩您刚刚在演讲中也提到了一个积极老龄化的态度。 然后包括您说年轻人应该有这样一个非常积极非常乐观的一个态度去看待年龄。 那您对年龄焦虑，尤其是年轻人和中年人面对的这个状况有哪些想法？\n讲者3：谢谢主持人确实蛮有意思的一个问题，我觉得其实在每个年龄阶段可能都不回避。 没有办法回避。 刚才也像陆教授谈的，其实每个人在世界上都是要来来往往的，四季有春夏秋冬。 人肯定也有，像你们这时候年轻的时候，像我们人到中年，然后再往后走的时候说不焦虑是假的，我觉得这个再智慧的长者，其实比如说我们说这个活过百岁的杨匠先生，他能那么看待的这个看人一生。 其实我觉得到最后叫焦虑，也好叫一种年轻时候的恐惧，到后面的无可奈何的接受。 其实这些都是不可否认的。 但是从另外一个角度来看，像你谈到的专家也谈到就是这种我们有一个积极老龄化或者我们叫怎么看待人的一生？ 其实永远持一个积极的态度。 我觉得是特别重要的，就是我们走过的路上其实都是风景，我们看到每一城对不起，我们看到每一城其实真的是各有各的美好。\n讲者3：就像我刚才提到其实你怎么看待你的生，我怎么看待老化这个事情？ 如果你觉得年龄不是一个限制，其实年龄就不会限制到你。 就是有很多的研究就发现，比如说让您让老年人在穿上他当年年轻时候的衣服，他的身体的机能立刻就又满血复活了。 其实听起来蛮奇妙的，但是确实是有这样的研究的。 所以简而言之，我觉得一个方面就是首先坦然的面对，我觉得人生有四季不焦虑是假的。 但是另外一个方面我们要意识到我们说人真的是有很多的能动性的。 其实如果时间在流逝，但是你不把年龄给自己设限，在人生的任何的时候，其实它都是你的资本。 而且只要你有一个积极的态度，我觉得生活其实永远是阳光的，就像刚才陆尔介绍的，其实一直走到人生的最后都可以很平和的，也像刚才李明教授谈到的，我觉得无疾而终。 平稳地走过去其实都是转就有可能的。 我是这么想，谢谢。\n讲者4：主持人，我补充两句，那个问题，你说，我特别同意刚才陆教授和这个李教授谈的。 我觉得其实因为现代社会的人我们应该心情更平和一点，为什么要心情更平和呢？ 原因就是因为我们过去 49 年新中国建立的时候，人均一区寿命只有 35 岁，我们现在是 77.3 岁，也就是说我们人人都实现了这个人生，这个就七十古来夕。 那么我相信现代的年轻人，你们未来活 100", "acc_len": 2.249433106575964}

Please review the contents of the article and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2015)\nThis article is about the family of vitamers. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione.\nVitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2.\nVitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed].\nChemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.\nVitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.\nBacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.\nThree synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>This report provides background information and issues for Congress on multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC), which are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC. Congress's decisions on these issues could affect defense acquisition practices, defense funding requirements, and the defense industrial base. A contract that the Air Force has for the procurement of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Launch Services (ELS) has sometimes been referred to as a block buy, but it is not an example of block buy contracting as discussed in this report. The Air Force in this instance is using the term block buy to mean something different. This report does not discuss the ELS contract. (For additional discussion, see \" Terminology Alert: Block Buy Contracting vs. Block Buys \" below.) In discussing MYP, BBC, and incremental funding, it can be helpful to distinguish contracting mechanisms from funding approaches. The two are often mixed together in discussions of DOD acquisition, sometimes leading to confusion. Stated briefly Funding approaches are ways that Congress can appropriate funding for weapon procurement programs, so that DOD can then put them under contract. Examples of funding approaches include traditional full funding (the standard or default approach), incremental funding, and advance appropriations. Any of these funding approaches might make use of advance procurement (AP) funding. Contracting mechanisms are ways for DOD to contract for the procurement of weapons systems, once funding for those systems has been appropriated by Congress. Examples of contracting mechanisms include annual contracting (the standard or default DOD approach), MYP, and BBC. Contracting mechanisms can materially change the total procurement cost of a ship. The use of a particular funding approach in a defense acquisition program does not dictate the use of a particular contracting mechanism. Defense acquisition programs consequently can be implemented using various combinations of funding approaches and contracting mechanisms. Most DOD weapon acquisition programs use a combination of traditional full funding and annual contracting. A few programs, particularly certain Navy shipbuilding programs, use incremental funding as their funding approach. A limited number of DOD programs use MYP as their contracting approach, and to date three Navy shipbuilding programs have used BBC as their contracting approach. The situation is summarized in Table 1 . This report focuses on the contracting approaches of MYP and BBC and how they compare to annual contracting. Other CRS reports discuss the funding approaches of traditional full funding, incremental funding, and advance appropriations. What is MYP, and how does it differ from annual contracting? MYP, also known as multiyear contracting, is an alternative to the standard or default DOD approach of annual contracting. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item, without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. To illustrate the basic difference between MYP and annual contracting, consider a hypothetical DOD program to procure 20 single-engine aircraft of a certain kind over the 5-year period FY2018-FY2022, at a rate of 4 aircraft per year: Under annual contracting , DOD would issue one or more contracts for each year's procurement of four aircraft. After Congress funds the procurement of the first four aircraft in FY2018, DOD would issue one or more contracts (or exercise a contract option) for those four aircraft. The next year, after Congress funds the procurement of the next four aircraft in FY2019, DOD would issue one or more contracts (or exercise a contract option) for those four aircraft, and so on. Under MYP , DOD would issue one contract covering all 20 aircraft to be procured during the 5-year period FY2018-FY2022. DOD would award this contract in FY2018, at the beginning of the five-year period, following congressional approval to use MYP for the program, and congressional appropriation of the FY2018 funding for the program. To continue the implementation of the contract over the next four years, DOD would request the FY2019 funding for the program as part of DOD's proposed FY2019 budget, the FY2020 funding as part of DOD's proposed FY2020 budget, and so on.

{"prompt": "<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>Paragraph 1: The U.S. is ranked 4th out of 34 developed nations for the highest incidence rate of homicides committed with a firearm, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data. Mexico, Turkey, Estonia are ranked ahead of the U.S. in incidence of homicides. A U.S. male aged 15–24 is 70 times more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight (G-8) largest industrialized nations in the world (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, Russia). In a broader comparison of 218 countries the U.S. is ranked 111. In 2010, the U.S.' homicide rate is 7 times higher than the average for populous developed countries in the OECD, and its firearm-related homicide rate was 25.2 times higher. In 2013, the United States' firearm-related death rate was 10.64 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants, a figure very close to Mexico's 11.17, although in Mexico firearm deaths are predominantly homicides whereas in the United States they are predominantly suicides. (Although Mexico has strict gun laws, the laws restricting carry are often unenforced, and the laws restricting manufacture and sale are often circumvented by trafficking from the United States and other countries.) Canada and Switzerland each have much looser gun control regulation than the majority of developed nations, although significantly more than in the United States, and have firearm death rates of 2.22 and 2.91 per 100,000 citizens, respectively. By comparison Australia, which imposed sweeping gun control laws in response to the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, has a firearm death rate of 0.86 per 100,000, and in the United Kingdom the rate is 0.26. In the year of 2014, there were a total of 8,124 gun homicides in the U.S. In 2015, there were 33,636 deaths due to firearms in the U.S, with homicides accounting for 13,286 of those, while guns were used to kill about 50 people in the U.K., a country with population one fifth of the size of the U.S. population. More people are typically killed with guns in the U.S. in a day (about 85) than in the U.K. in a year, if suicides are included. With deaths by firearm reaching almost 40,000 in the U.S. in 2017, their highest level since 1968, almost 109 people died per day. A study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2018, states that the worldwide gun death reach 250,000 Yearly and the United States is among only six countries that make up half of those fatalities.\n\nParagraph 2: Cromwell also served as the head coach of the USC Trojans football program from 1909 to 1910, and from 1916 to 1918. His involvement with USC football goes back even farther; he is known to have officiated USC games as early as 1903, and he played (along with the coaches of both teams) for USC opponent Harvard School in a 1905 game due to the weakness of the Harvard roster. In his first term as coach, 1909 to 1910, he posted a record of 10–1–3, but this was exclusively against southern California competition, with no major colleges on the schedule. Like many schools, USC switched from football to rugby, from 1911 to 1913. Cromwell returned as football coach in 1916, by which time USC's teams had begun to be known as the Trojans. By this point, the university was facing competition which more regularly included major colleges such as California, Utah and Stanford, and his relative lack of expertise in the sport was more readily apparent. World War I also depleted the team's ranks in 1917 and 1918. In his final three years his record was still respectable at 11–7–3, though only 4–4–1 against major colleges. In his final season in 1918, USC was 2–2–2.  They did not play a home game in Los Angeles until December 14 due to a citywide ban on public gatherings during the Spanish flu epidemic.  Cromwell was replaced as head football coach following the season by Gus Henderson. During his tenure, Cromwell compiled a 21–8–6 record. Apart from Sam Barry, who took over the 1941 team in the wake of Howard Jones' death, Cromwell was the last USC football coach for whom it was not his primary sport. He also coached the USC basketball team in 1918, though they only played two games against the Los Angeles Athletic Club, losing both.\n\nParagraph 3: A United Nations peacekeeping force – UNAMIR – had been stationed in Rwanda since October 1993", "acc_len": 2.2698412698412698}
